2005-02-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_CO.c, YAM_MI.c, misc: implemented a system default charset
      recognition method where YAM will try to check the configured charset
      of the system it is running on and compares it to the LocalCharset
      settings of the YAM configuration. If YAM then finds out that the
      system charset doesn't match the localcharset it will put up a warning
      requester where the user can choose to either change the local charset
      or ignore the requester.
      However, please note that a proper system charset identification is only
      fully implemented in AmigaOS4. On all other platforms YAM will try
      to find a CHARSET environment variable which contains the currently
      active charset of the system.
    * YAM_MI.c: fixed bug where the source charset specification was used
      in the RFC2047 encoding routines, instead of the destination charset
      which fixes bug #1107821
    * YAM.c: the "mark new mail as unread" upon startup feature did still
      calculate the amount of unread/new mails slightly incorrect.
    * classes/ReadWindow.c, misc: fixed bug where YAM wasn't able to save the
      vertical weights of the headerlist and texteditor group anymore.
      Also revised the way YAM will save the different weights of GUI elements.
      Previously YAM did save the orientation of all GUI elements upon quiting
      the application. Now YAM will only save these settings if the window
      is "snapshotted" via the MUI window snapshot option. So if you want to
      save either the GUI elements setup in the main or read window you have
      to use the MUI snapshot option instead of having to quit the whole
      application to make YAM save these settings.

2005-02-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * classes/AttachmentImage&Group.c: make YAM save the diskobject of an
      attachment if the attachment is dropped onto a workbench drawer.
      This should also fix the notification problems/issue already reported
      as bug #1138672.
    * classes/Splashwindow.c: fixed bug #1084418 where the progress gauge
      were not correctly displayed under certain situations because of
      refeshing problem in the main window class of MUI.
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug #1098671 where upon moving/deleting a mail through
      a filter didn't update the folder statistics correctly.
    * classes/AttachmentGroup.c: added some _mtop/_mleft checkings to make
      sure no text is drawn outside our rastport. This should hopefully fix
      bug #1123850
    * YAM_RE.c: YAM was not only closing an open read window while getting
      iconified, but also cleaning up the whole read mail data which results
      in a lost read window after reopening the application.
    * YAM.c: fixed bug where the amount of new mails was not correctly resetted
      to unread when the UpdateNewMail feature was enabled for YAM startup
      processing. Now YAM should show all folder statistics correctly after
      startup.
    * YAM_MA.c, YAM_RE.c, ReadWindow.c: fixed bug where YAM didn't close an
      open read window on a Delete/Move operation even if no mail was left in
      the corresponding folder. Now YAM should close the read window after the
      last mail has been deleted/moved out by the user.

2005-02-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_utilities.h: reverted the evaluation of the return value of GetAttr()
      as part of our xget() inline function. It seems that with some attributes
      (e.g. MUIA_Selected) MUI always returns FALSE. However, setting b=0
      right before the GetAttr() call should catch cases in which the attribute
      really doesn't exist.
    * AttachmentGroup.c: fixed a bug where upon a mail switching the
      image object weren't cleaned up correctly which caused YAM to crash if
      it was brought back from an iconify state.
    * Makefile, extrasrc/dice.c: minor changes to make YAM easier compileable
      with a vanilla OS3.9 NDK.
    * YAM_debug.h: put the NOP statements back into as there is no real reason
      for not having them. They increase the security, are supported by all
      common gcc versions and are anyway removed during optimization. And if
      a properitery compiler doesn't support it, please do add a separate
      #ifdef for that case. Just removing them for the sake of supporting
      other compilers isn't an alternative.
    * ReadMailGroup, misc: renamed all internal "Photo" ocurrances to
      "Image" because that name is used all over the place in YAM for the
      SenderImage.
    * AttachmentImage.c: fixed a possible buffer overrun

2005-02-16  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * classes/AttachmentImage.c: replace calloc() with malloc().
    * classes/AttachmentImage.c: wrap DB statement of else-case into {}.
    * YAM_debug.h: revert previous change (NOP addition).
    * Makefile: revert LDLIBS change.
    * classes/AttachmentImage.c: use non-varargs function.
    * classes/AttachmentGroup.c: use non-varargs functions and require v44
      (OS 3.5) only.
    * extrasrc/dice.c: add stubs for icon+wb v44
      (these should be in amiga.lib but ...)

2005-02-16  Alexey Ivanov <AmiS@amiga.org.ru>

    * ReadMailGroup, misc: added 'image only' mode to show sender image in
      read window without other sender infos.

2005-02-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * AttachmentGroup, WriteAttachmentList: implemented the missing drag&drop
      functionality of the new attachment images. Now a user can drag&drop
      an attachment image directly into a workbench drawer (v45+ workbench)
      or to an attachment listview of a write window. YAM will then
      automatically export/copy the attachment in question to the selected
      destination.

2005-02-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * misc: fixed a bug in the temporary file handling where it happened
      that due to the limited way the filenames of the tempfiles were
      generated, some undefined behaviour in mail handling occurred
      such that the wrong attachments were opened after mail switching.

2005-02-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c, misc: slightly reworked the ReadInMessage() routines to not
      show attachments inlined generally anymore because the new attachment
      group is now the replacement for that. However, if the user selected
      that he/she wants to display textbased attachments inlined, then YAM
      still shows these attachments as before.
      Also adapted the general mail flags a bit to better reflect the
      different multipart types in future. However, please note that this
      change required to bump the .index version to make sure all indexes
      are rescanned properly.
    * classes/AttachmentImage&Group: implemented two new internal MUI
      custom classes for showing a separate attachment group object in
      every readmail object of either the read window or the embedded
      mail view. This attachment group displays images for every attachment
      found in a mail. These images are either obtained with the help
      of DefIcons or due to icon.library operations and dragable.
      The images are clickable to select attachments for later operations
      like saving, printing etc. In addition, context menus are enabled
      in this group and allows to directly start these operations.
      The group is implemented auto-sizable, which means that the images
      for attachments are automatically grouped in columns. However, if the
      space for the group doesn't fit all attachments it will automatically
      be resized to make it possible to fit all attachments in the group.
      In addition to the images also some rough information about the
      attachments is displayed.
    * YAM_debug.h: put some NOP ((void)0) statements in the empty
      parts of our debug defines. This should fix some problems where
      else branches with single debug statements caused some troubles if
      YAM was compiled without any debugging turned on.

2005-02-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * UserImage.c: fixed bug #1115135 where the user image wasn't
      always displayed correctly on all machines which seem to be
      cause by the missing BMF_MINPLANES flag for the AllocBitMap()
      call.
    * YAM_COs.c: the checkmark status for the status delay change
      wasn't saved in the .config file at all. That should be fixed
      now.

2005-02-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c: fixed a bug in the timerIO evaluation routines where the
      additional CheckIO/WaitIO combo seemed to have cause that some
      timer events were get lost under certain circumstances. Hopefully
      the whole emitting and receiving of the timer events should be
      more rock proofed now.
    * YAM_MAf.c: slightly modified the folderlist highlighting once more.
      Now YAM will not use the highlighting pen anymore and use two
      different ways of highlighting folders with new and/or unreaded
      mail. In fact, if a folder contains new mail the folder name will
      get bold and if it just contains unread mail it will also turn
      gray to signal that this folder just contain unread, not newly
      downloaded mail. Also the amount of unread/new mails will be
      appended to the folder name in case the corresponding column
      is not turned on. This whole change should give the user a more
      easy way of quickly finding out which folder carries new and unread
      mail.

2005-02-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MAf.c, ReadMailGroup.c: fixed bug #1114873 where a multiselect
      operation during an enabled embedded mail pane acted a bit
      strange from a users point of view. Now YAM will clear up the
      read pane in case a multiselect operation is underway.
    * YAM_MAf.c, YAM_MA.c: slightly modified the folderlist to not
      use the MUI highlight pen for signaling that a folder group
      has folders with new mail in it. Also adapted the mail list
      to show unread/new mails using bold text as this might be
      a better approach for easily finding unread/new mail in the
      list. However, lets see how users like that little change
      which is similar to what Thunderbird is actually doing.
    * YAM_CO.c: changed the default embedded mail pane display
      delay to 200ms as this might be a more reasonable value and
      also renamed the option to "EmbeddedMailDelay" which should me
      more intuitive.
    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_utilities.h, YAM_WR.c: renamed our properitery
      strtok_r() to carry some uppercase letters so that it may not
      conflict with the strtok_r() function available in newer clib2
      runtime library versions. However, in future we might better
      rewrite our function to carry the same function prototype than
      the standard strtok_r() function.
    * ReadWindow.c: removed another bunch of "-repeat" key definition
      to prevent a continious deletion of mails by holding down the
      delete key.
	 
2005-02-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * UserImage.c: another minor change to the UserImage custom class
      where the PDTM_SCALE method call has been replaced by bit a more
      widely available BitMapScale() call. This should drop the
      requirement of an installed picture.datatype v45. In addition
      the minimum height calculation of the user image has been altered
      so that it is still possible to resize the attached NList object
      to its minium values. This should make the userimage fit a bit
      better into the overall layout of the ReadMailGroup object.

2005-01-31  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * UserImage.c: fixed bug #1113084 where the proportional image
      scaling routines where such "proportional". Now the user images
      should be perfectly scaled taking respect of their width/height
      proportion. I also tried to fix another flaw in the user image
      display where a small space is displayed below the image.
      However, this is currently hard to resolve and points more towards
      a possible MUI bug. Lets see if we can work around it later on.

2005-01-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * misc: renamed the previously named "mail preview" to the more
      intuitive name "embedded read pane" because in fact the new GUI
      element is not only showing just a preview, but act as a full
      embedded read window.
    * classes/UserImage.c: implemented a new internal custom class which
      manages the images of the addressbook users and displays it in the
      read window or embeeded mailview, instead of the formerly used
      Dtpic.mui class. Also implemented a small scaling routine which
      uses the PDTM_SCALE method of picture.datatype to scale down
      the image proportional if it exceeds the limit of 64x64 pixels.
      This should also fix bug #1109541.

2005-01-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c: removed "-repeat" from the DELETE key definition that is
      used to delete a mail from the main mailwindow. As deletion is a
      very dangerous part it might be a good idea to not allow to hold
      the delete key which would cause the continious deletion of several
      mails if the user holds down the del key for too long.
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed crash that occurred when trying to open a virtual
      mail in a separate window.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #1108922 which caused a crash upon closing the main
      window if no embedded read pane was enabled and YAM was exited immediately
      after the startup.
    * YAM_RE.c, YAM_TR.c : fixed bug #1110862 where switching the embedded read
      pane on/off could have left the user with the wrong or no mail displayed in
      the embedded read pane. Also reworked some of the embedded read pane
      generation code to be a bit cleaner.

2005-01-27  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: Simplify timer functions, eg. use TC_Stop in TC_Start and
      TC_Exit. Remove tabs und superflous casts.

2005-01-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * misc: added new StatusChangeDelay functionality to YAM that changes
      the status of a NEW/UNREAD mail to READ only after a configured
      time interval passed. This should increase the usability of the
      previously introduced embedded read pane because YAM will now only change
      the status of a mail after that short interval passed. However, for
      doubleclicking a mail the behaviour hasn't been changed as that
      user operation should be certain enough to tell that the user really
      wanted to read that particular mail.
    * ReadWindow.c, ReadMailGroup.c: the mailtextedit object will again be
      the default object if a new read window is created.
    * YAM_stringsizes.h: slightly modified the string sizes for the filename
      and path buffers again.
    * ReadMailGroup.c, YAM_UT.c: fixed a minor bug in the user image display
      routines which caused unexpected crashes and behaviour when switching
      between messages that cause YAM to display the appropriate user image.
      Also slightly modifed the display of those user images so that they
      are aligned to the top and don't use a scrollgroup anymore which make
      them a bit more compact.

2005-01-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c: used the modular functionality of our new internal readmail
      classes to integrate an embedded mail read pane similar to others found
      in mail clients like Thunderbird&Co. This pane always shows the currently
      selected mail which allows to read the mail without having to open any
      separate window. However, as this is a new major feature the pane can
      be disabled in the main YAM configuration to ensure the old behaviour
      without any pane.
      In addition, to make the browsing in the mail list a bit smoother, the
      pane will only load the new selected mail after a specified short time
      interval which can however be altered in the hidden configuration of YAM.
      Per default this timeinterval is 100ms, which means that if the user
      hasn't moved on in the mail list for 100ms YAM will load and display the
      last selected mail into the embedded mail pane.
    * YAM_RE.c, ...: reworked the whole ReadWindow related codebase, separated
      the window code from the readmail code and integrated it into own
      internal custom MUI classes. This, aside from the more modular and
      safer approach for reading mails, allows now to put an unlimited number
      of readmail objects whereever required.
      In fact, YAM does now support to open an unlimited number of read window
      instead of just the old possible maximum of 3 simultaneous opened read
      windows when the "Multiple windows" option is enabled in the YAM config.

        ATTENTION: Please note that due to the heaps of changes in the
        development of this new object-oriented readwindow facility, some
        features dependent on the old behaviour might be broken. This can
        include, but is not limited to, Arexx commands previously expecting/
        serving only for up to a maximum of 3 possible read windows. So if you
        stumble over a problem with the new readmail facility, please don't
        hestitate to bring it to our attention so that we can fix it immediatly.
	 
2005-01-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_stringsizes.h: increased the SIZE_FILE buffer length define
      to 107 and the SIZE_PATH define to 1024. This does not only fix
      problem when trying to add files as an attachment if their filename
      is larger than 30 chars, but also should make YAM a bit safer when
      dealing with huge directory path lengths.
    * YAM_MAf.c: YAM does now check the archive bit of the folder
      directory and the .index file as well before issuing an automatic
      index rebuild. This should prevent YAM from rescanning all folders
      after a backup program has set all archive bits in a folder
      directory and therefore modified the directory timestamp as well.
    * extrasrc/getft.c: converted function to FileTime() function
      in YAM_UT.c and removed it completly.

2005-01-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * classes/MainFolderListtree.c: added an additional contextmenu item
      which allows to expunge all mails in the deleted folder and which
      is only available if used on the deleted folder.
    * YAM_global.c: Changed the application wide copyright string to
      reflect the new year.
    * YAM.c: improved the expiration and developer version requesters to
      show the new internet addresses for further reference.

2004-11-25  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * supportfiles/contrib/Gfx/Matt_Chaput/#?: Add toolbar graphics by
      Matt Chaput with his permission.

2004-11-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_WR.c: modified MessageID and BoundaryID generation code to
      generate somewhat more unique IDs. The MessageID generation code
      was not so unique as we thought and the BoundaryID code wasn't
      conform to RFC2045. Now we should be very well on the safe side
      in generating world-unique IDs. Noticed by Krille.

2004-11-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAN_AB.c, extrasrc/atcsma.c: applied patch #1071505 which requested
      to remove the obsolete use of the astcsma() function which was a
      duplicate of the MatchNoCase() function in YAM_UT.c.

2004-11-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_WR.c: fixed a minor bug in a MUIM_MultiSet notify connection
      where the argument counts were too low which could have caused some
      unexpected trouble.

2004-11-19  Alexey Ivanov <AmiS@amiga.org.ru>

    * YAM_COg.c: fixed bug #773860 - Charset gadget not fully disabled
      if Autodetect is on.

2004-11-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c: fixed a minor bug in the mail status handling which didn't
      allow a user to manually set/unset a mail to/from the HOLD status.
      Modified all HOLD status handling accordingly.

2004-11-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * misc: fixed bug #1052533 where mail couldn't be move to a simple
      password protected folder. Also reworked the whole folder mode
      handling during this fix and renamed the "XPKType" parameter of
      folder configurations to "Mode" and replaced the internal flag
      handling with a more proper enum variable for handling the folder
      modes (normal/simple/compressed/crypted).

2004-11-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_main.h: fixed bug #1062983 which didn't clear the Error flag
      of a mail upon a successfull sent operation.

2004-11-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug in the message disposition notification reply
      routines where a mail status update call was placed slightly wrong,
      which caused crashes under certain situations.

2004-11-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_TR.c, YAM_COg.c: implemented full SMTP SSLv3 compatibility and
      added a possibility to directly select the secure connection method
      for SMTP connections in the configuration. In contrast to TLSv1, the
      SSLv3 method directly connects to the specified port and initiates the
      secure connection without previously querying the mail server via the
      STARTTLS command, which is quite common for some SMTP-SSL servers out
      there. Noticed missing by Krille.
    * misc: replaced all GUI based "APTR" occurances with proper "Object *"
      types. This is no functional change but should make the source better
      maintainable in future.
    * YAM_rexx.c: minor changed to the ReadArgs() calling mechanism of YAM's
      ARexxPort implementation to conform a bit better to the documented
      standard.

2004-10-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * Splashwindow.c: replaced all MUIA_ShowMe usages by proper
      MUIM_Group_Init/ExitChange calls to hopefully fix the window corruption
      due to the dynamic adding/removing of objects.
    * YAM_MAf.c: reworked the index scanning routines a bit so that they
      will now ask the user if an unknown file in a folder directory should
      be considered a normal mailfile instead of just ignoring it. This
      makes it a bit handier for people wanting to quickly copy a mailfile
      to a folder directory without having to explicitly use the import
      functionality of YAM.
    * YAM_MI.c: fixed another bug in the base64 file decoding routines where
      attachments with lots of whitespaces caused YAM to through an error
      message instead of simply skipping them.

2004-10-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c: simplifies the copy/move routines in the TransferMailFile()
      function and also squeezed a bug which didn't correctly move/copy
      files from/to a XPK compressed/encrypted folder.
    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_MA.c: changed the return values the TransferMailFile()
      function returns, resulting in a slightly improved possibility to
      return error conditions. Also added an additional error message if
      the XPK compression/uncompression failes because the XPK library
      returned an error value itself.
    * YAM_MI.c: fixed a minor bug in the base64 encoding routines where it
      could have happened that YAM wrote too much encoded data at the end
      of a file and therefore produced mails with corrupted attachments

2004-10-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c, misc: reworked DateStamp2String() function to not work
      with a static variable because it happend in the past that routines
      used it incorrectly, resulting e.g. in the maillistview displaying
      wrong or cutted timevalues.
    * YAM_MAf.c, YAM_FI.c: fixed some buffer overflows which were caused by
      some unterminated strncpy() usages and resulted in messages showing
      a size of -1.

2004-09-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_TR.c: introduced new MoveFile() function which allows
      to move a file from one partition to another and adapted the
      TransferMailFile() function accordingly. Now folders don't have to
      be stored on the same partition for being able to exchange mail files.
    * YAM_CO.c: fixed bug in the socket options configuration parsing
      routines where YAM didn't recognize an existing "SO_RCVTIMEO"
      option correctly.
    
2004-09-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_CL.c, YAM_classes.h: removed source files as all the old custom
      classes has been moved to the new class system now.
    * ConfigPageList.c: moved CL_PageList to new classes system as
      "ConfigPageList" class.
    * BodychunkImage.c: moved CL_Bodychunk to new classes system as
      "BodychunkImage" class.
    * WriteAttachmentList.c: moved CL_AttachList to new classes system as
      "WriteAttachmentList" class.
    * MainFolderListtree.c: moved CL_FolderList to new classes system as
      "MainFolderListtree" class.
    * MainMailList.c: moved CL_MainList to new classes system as
      "MainMailList" class.
    * AddrBookEntryList.c: moved CL_DDList to new classes system as
      "AddrBookEntryList" class.
    * AddrBookListtree.c: moved CL_AddrList to new classes system as
      "AddrBookListtree" class.
    * MainWindow.c: moved CL_MainWindow custom class implementation to
      the new classes system as the "MainWindow" class.
    
2004-09-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * MailTextEdit.c: moved CL_TextEditor custom class implementation
      to the new classes system as "MailTextEdit".

2004-09-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * misc: added some missing MUI_DisposeObject() calls on some
      requesters. This might have caused that YAM ate more memory
      during a long usage period than necessary.
    * extrasrc/NewReadArgs.c: fixed bug in NewReadArgs() function where
      tooltype-less icons like the PNG icons of PowerIcons caused a
      basepage access if used as the application icon of YAM.
    * YAM_MI.c: slightly modified the RFC 2047 decoding to recognize
      also encoded-words which are surrounded by " chars as more than
      one emailer out there seems to encode such words. However, please
      note that such encoded-words are not compliant to the RFC 2047
      standard and are now just accepted for convienence.

2004-09-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c: reworked and redesigned the old "About" window parts
      and splitted them into two separate custom classes "Aboutwindow"
      and "Splashwindow". As the name implies the first one is only
      to display information if the user selects the "About" menu
      item from within the main application. In contrast, the
      second one is now the new startup (also called "Splash")
      window when YAM loads/initializes all main data.

2004-09-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MAf.c: fixed recognition of Importance: and Priority:
      headerlines after it has been broken during the rework
      of the status handling.
    * YAM_global.c: fixed $STACK: definition as it had been
      removed by the gcc3 optimizer. Also added a proper
      __stack_size definition for clib2. This should hopefully
      fix some stack related problems while using YAM on OS3 and
      OS4.

2004-09-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: added rfc2047 decoding to the MIME content-type
      and content-disposition subheader fields so that the
      filename, description and name of those fields get
      automatically decoded upon mail reading.
    * YAM_MA.c, YAM_MAf.c, YAM_TR.c: now that the new status
      handling is implemented I finished my work on the "Status:"
      and "X-Status:" headerline handling stuff when importing
      or exporting mails from/to MBOX formatted files.
    * YAM_UT.c: convered all Examine()/ExNext() usages to proper
      ExAll() calls which slightly increases the performance
      in traversing through directory entries.
    * YAM_UT.c: removed the not required stccat() function.
    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug where a "MAILSTATUS O" didn't
      work anymore after the recent mail status changes.
    * YAM_RE.c: changed read window title formating to include
      three dots "..." at the end of the text if it was too huge
      to put it into the buffer and therefore was cut.

2004-09-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c: fixed a minor bug which caused that with the
      new mailfile naming scheme YAM wasn't able to display the
      RAW text of a mail because the mailfile name changed.
    * YAM_MA.c, YAM_RE.c, YAM_TR.c, YAM_UT.c: reworked the
      FormatSize() invocation a bit and removed a unnecessary
      strlen() call as we anyway call this function mostly to put
      stuff at the start of the string. This change also works
      around a tempoaray problem with the clib2 runtime library
      which seem to be broken with empty sprintf() calls and
      caused problem with the size display in the read window.

2004-09-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * Mail filenames: in accordance to the change in the mail
      status handling I took the oppurtunity to rework the mail
      filename handling aswell as this was anyway a pending
      issue. Now YAM uses a totally different scheme in how it
      names mail files (abutted to the maildir format).
      As it has been always a bad idea to use the amiga specific
      file comments for storing mail META data like status and
      transfer time, YAM does now store this information in the
      mail filename only, making it possible to place those files
      on file systems like NFS.
      The new scheme it uses now is as followed:

        XXXXXXXXXXXX.001,RAFNQHSDME

      where the first 12 chars (X) are used for the base64 encoded
      transfer date followed by a dot (.), then followed by a
      3 chars long control variable followed by a comma (,),
      then followed by the currently available 10 possible status
      flags:

        [R] - SFLAG_READ
        [A] - SFLAG_REPLIED
        [F] - SFLAG_FORWARDED
        [N] - SFLAG_NEW
        [Q] - SFLAG_QUEUED
        [H] - SFLAG_HOLD
        [S] - SFLAG_SENT
        [D] - SFLAG_DELETED
        [M] - SFLAG_MARKED
        [E] - SFLAG_ERROR

      Please note that this change required to increase the index
      version so that all folders will be automatically reindexed,
      including renaming of all mail files to the new used scheme.

        ATTENTION: On the first use of this version, YAM will
        convert all mail files to the new scheme, which of course
        makes them slightly incompatible to any earlier version.
        This means that if you have converted all of your folders
        with this version there will be NO easy way back in using
        any older version - so please consider making a raw backup
        of all your folders first.

    * Statushandling: totally reworked the way YAM deals with mail
      statuses. Previously YAM was very limited in dealing with many
      different status flags and only used a hand full of statuses where
      not all of them could be combined and which weren't quite enough
      for our future development. Especially if we want to implement
      IMAP in future or other highly status relating things.
      YAM now uses very common and standard status distinctions like:

        READ      - mail was read by user
        REPLIED   - mail has been replied by user
        FORWARDED - mail has been forwarded to another user
        NEW       - mail is marked as a new incoming mail
        QUEUED    - mail is scheduled for delivery
        HOLD      - mail is locked
        SENT      - mail has been sucessfully sent out
        DELETED   - mail is flagged as deleted
        MARKED    - mail is marked by user
        ERROR     - an error occurred on the mail transfer

      Please note that YAM can now theoretically combine all of
      those flags, but it uses some masking to flag out statuses
      which doesn't make sense if they are both set at the same time
      (i.e. NEW and READ).

2004-08-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_TR.c, YAM_MA.c: started working on Status: and X-Status:
      export/import support when I realized that the whole mail
      status handling in YAM seems to be a total mess. So this is
      just a partial checking leaving the Status: headerline
      support yet unfinished until I have completly reworked the
      mail status flags handling.

2004-08-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c, YAM_MI.c: rewrote the inline based UUdecoding
      recognition/processing to use the new optimized UUdecoding
      routines instead of the old unbuffered ones. Dropped the
      old routines accordingly.

2004-07-31  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MI.c: rewrote the last major MIME routine (UU decoding)
      from scratch. By using the same approach like for the other
      rewritten MIME encoding/decoding routines, the decoding of
      UUcode attachments seems to be dramatically faster now (~3MB
      in less than a second compared to 6 seconds previously). So
      the MIME encoding/decoding routines seem to be working very
      instantly now. However, there are still two minor routines
      missing which we will address during the next few days. Then
      we can move on to other parts that require our attention.

2004-07-29  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MI.c: rewrote the UU MIME encoding routines from scratch.
      Introduced separate input and output buffers like with the
      other new reworked MIME encoding routines. This sped up the
      encoding process to only 1/3 of which the original old
      unbuffered routines took. Now only the UUdecoding routines
      are missing and then all MIME routines are completly fresh :)

2004-07-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MI.c: slightly modified the rfc2047 quoted-printable
      decoding routines to use the global lookup table instead of 
      extensive string functions. This should perhaps speed up the
      routines once more.
    * YAM_MI.c, YAM_RE.c: also rewrote the quoted-printable decoding
      routines from scratch and reimplemented everything according to
      RFC 2045. Also this new routines have full input and output
      buffers now which increases the decoding performance on large
      files dramatically.
    * YAM_MI.c, YAM_WR.c: completly rewritten and optimized the
      RFC 2045 quoted-printable MIME encoding routines from scratch.
      The encoding is now done fully buffered which results in a
      greater performance during encoding of large attachment if the
      quoted-printable encoding is used.

2004-07-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MI.c: fixed another minor bug in the RFC2047 decoding
      routines which caused encoded-words not to be decoded if they
      were embeeded in RFC822 style comments delimited by ( and ).
    * YAM_FI.c, InfoBar.c: modified all major gauge displays to only 
      refresh themself in respect to a maximum given refresh time
      - twice a second. This has for example the result that on fast
      machines the message find mechanism is dramatically faster now,
      because YAM doesn't have to refresh the gauge all the time.

2004-07-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MI.c, YAM_WR.c: completly rewrote the RFC2047 MIME encoding
      routines which were quiet broken and didn't really work as
      expected/documented in the official RFC paper. Along with this
      the whole RFC2047 mime encoding/decoding process has been
      syncronized and should perfect a bit better than the old routines.
      Of course, these new routines still need testing to get them
      stable for every case, but they should hopefully already
      perform quiet good.

2004-07-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * SDI_#?.h: added the new SDI_lib.h and SDI_stdarg.h special
      macro definition headers which allow to use macros/defines
      for variable arguments support functions instead of cluttered
      #ifdef constructs. Also the added SDI_lib.h allows to
      define library functions and library vectors in an operating
      system independent fashion, too. In fact, those two new
      headers should make some code better readable and backward
      compatible in future.

2004-06-29  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MI.c: fixed a bug in the base64 file decoding routines
      where it happened that the selected temporary output buffer
      had been to low and cause some unexpected crashes.

2004-06-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MAf.c: to make the index rebuilding process upon start of
      YAM a bit less painfull and memory consuming, the rebuilt
      index will now be immediatly flushed so that several
      successive index rebuilts should not consume all available
      memory anymore.

2004-05-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * os4: removed the OS4 dependent ASM stub again as the OS4
      kernel starting from version 51.4 finally supports m68k<>ppc
      cross calls.

2004-03-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MI.c: in analogy to the new base64 encoding routines I
      again reworked the base64 decoding routines and introduced a
      seperate I/O buffer. By using this buffer it was possible to
      increase the overall performance of the decoding by ~300%.
      Aside from this great speed up, the decoding should be much
      more afer and accurate than before.

2004-03-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_AB.c: correctly fixed the DoubleClick and OpenFunc Hooks
      where within the change on 14th February the default cases
      had been specified incorrectly which caused different
      problems in using the addressbook.
    * YAM_MI.c, YAM_WR.c: completly rewrote the base64 file encoding
      routines to use the recently new introduced base64encode()
      function. Aside from the effect of having a more robust base64
      file encoding routine now, this increased the performance
      especially with large files to about 150% of the old retired
      function. Now only the old UU and quoted printable routines
      have to be rewritten to have all MIME I/O functions to be
      uptodate and also hopefully sped up.

2004-03-25  Alexey Ivanov <amis@amiga.org.ru>

    * YAM_AB.c: fixed "Address Book double click" bug, introduction 
      since 14.02.2004.

2004-03-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * all: fixed a bunch of SAS/C dependent compiler warnings which
      stopped YAM from compiling out-of-the-box.
      Please note that a compilation with the old SAS/C compiler
      is considered obsolete now. That means that future compilations
      will be based on the gcc compiler builds. As a consequence,
      future SAS/C compatibility will not ensured anymore. So this
      is probably the last SAS/C compatibility change. This means
      that if future versions will not build with SAS/C we are not
      going to dig our heads deeper into those SAS/C dependent stuff.
      So please move to gcc compilation if you are compiling YAM from
      source.

2004-03-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_global.c: moved the compiler information specification
      from YAM.c to YAM_global.c,h as this is really a better place
      for it. Also reverted the previously introduced
      -m68020-60 CPU identification behaviour as this has been
      changed in the latest gcc 3.3.3 68k version now.

2004-03-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_global.c: changed version string CPU information to
      place a simple [68k] string to the $VER: string if YAM was
      compiled with either the -m68020-40 or -m68020-60 option.
    * added support for specifying socket options in the .config
      file within the hidden section. Per default no additional
      socket options are specified, so the TCP/IP stack defaults
      are used. However, in some cases it may increase the
      transfer speed and probably reduce the latency of connections.
      Please note that the syntax for specifying socket options in
      the hidden section is similar to specifying socket options
      in Samba. For example, with LAN based connections it may make
      sense to specify the "SocketOptions" option as:
      "SO_KEEPALIVE TCP_NODELAY IPTOS_LOWDELAY SO_SNDBUF=16384
       SO_RCVBUF=16384"
      In addition to that, the options "SO_SNDTIMEO=x" and
      "SO_RCVTIMEO=x" may be usfull in cases where connections are
      stalled and an automatic timeout for transfers are required.
      To be more precise, documentation follows ASAP.
    * added support for directly specifying the buffer size for
      the TCP/IP routines of YAM in the hidden configuration
      section. Per default a "TRBufferSize = 8192" is used, which
      should be sufficient for most jobs.

2004-03-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * retired the old socket library includes in favour of the new
      bsdsocket.library interface of Roadshow. This doesn`t mean you
      need Roadshow for a working YAM, but it will allow us to use
      special features of Roadshow in future as this is going to be
      the default TCP/IP stack of future AmigaOS versions.
    * YAM.c: added compiler version to compile information of the
      about/splash window. As YAM can be compiled with different
      versions and types of compilers it`s probably a good idea
      to have an information about that in the about window.
    * all: fixed some more compiler warnings which occurred by
      introducing the -W compiler option. Now xget() is defined
      as an inline function and used everywhere throughout the
      sources so that the type-punned gcc warnings of gcc3
      disappear.

2004-03-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * all: fixed some compiler warnings which are mainly caused by
      unused parameters and so on.
    * Makefiles: added -W option to get out more detailed warning
      messages from the gcc compiler.

2004-02-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MI.c: fixed recently introduced bug in base64decode_file()
      routines and changed alogrithm to use pointer-arithmetic instead
      of direct array access methods.

2004-02-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MI.c, YAM_RE.c, YAM_UT.c: fixed a bug in the
      base64decode_file() routines where the routines where unable
      to deal with base64 encoded strings that weren`t a multiple
      of 4.
    * YAM.c, YAM_TR.c, YAM_UT.c: retired the YAM_compat.h header in
      favour of some preprocessor macro sets. Sorry Gunther, but your
      intention to use the DCE feature of the compiler is a bit unwanted
      here. It makes it impossible to compile a debug version of YAM
      because if the optimizer of the compiler is disabled, the unused
      parts of YAM produce a unresolve symbols error on linking. And IMHO
      it is anyway a better solution to use preprocessor macros here.

2004-02-20  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_compat.h: OS4 compatibility header.
    * YAM.c, YAM_TR.c, YAM_UT.c: Use it.

2004-02-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * smakefile: adapted SAS/C makefile to also put all object
      files in a separate object directory like the gcc makefiles.

2004-02-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * fixed a whole bunch of gcc dependent compiler warnings. Now
      it should compile without any warning if gcc 2.95.3 is used.
    * Makefile.OS4/MorphOS: modified and improved makefiles and
      synced them with the latest changes done to the main Makefile.

2004-02-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * Makefile: modified and improved. Now it omits the compiler
      command line and puts the object files in a separate directory.
    * OS4: final changes to get a first working native PPC version
      for AmigaOS4. Now it at least seems to popup the GUI and
      doesn't crash on exit anymore. Let's see if it also works
      reliable for others now.

2004-02-12  Alexey Ivanov <amis@amiga.org.ru>

    * MOS: generate correct ppcinline. Change makefile for MorphOS.

2004-01-31  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c: enhanced the text quoting routines once more. Now
      they also take care of indentions and should work more
      accurate now.

2004-01-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * OS4: some more modifications to get YAM working on AmigaOS4.

2004-01-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c: slightly modified InitLib() to correctly set the library
      base from the pointer that is provided as an argument. Previously
      only the local pointer was set and returned, which was not
      exactly my intention in first place ;)
      
2004-01-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * OS4: finally YAM compiles and links with the AmigaOS4
      cross compiler and the standard SDK. Added the OS4 new
      style GetInterface/DropInterfac calls throughout the whole
      sources. Now it's time for some tests because there are surely
      still some OS4 dependant problems we have to solve before
      we can consider this OS4 port stable.

2004-01-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * OS4: more adaptions to the includes and some sources to get
      more AmigaOS4 compatible.

2004-01-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * Makefile.OS4: added first version of AmigaOS4 aware makefile.
      In the event of preparing a first OS4 version some includes
      has been altered in the includes directory and sources were
      adapted were necessary. The OS4 version still doesn`t compile
      yet, but lets hope we can sort the problems out soon.

2004-01-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * updated all sources and locale files to reflect the year 2004
      within the copyright messages.
    * YAM_UT.c: after receiving some bug reports about some screwed
      up text while replying mails, I realized that the quotation
      functions of YAM were somehow totally broken and way to
      complicated/slow.
      Therefore I totally rewrote the functions for generating
      quoted reply texts as well as applying an automatic wordwrap
      if some text passages exceed the specified text width. Like
      anything new, this needs some more testing before these new
      routines can be considered stable, but the first tests with
      some complicated mails look good and promising that this new
      functions work way better than the previous more or less
      cryptic version.

2004-01-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c: reworked the PlaySound() function to not use any
      temporary signals to get noticed when the sound is finished
      with playing. This should fixed the reported lock ups which
      sometimes happens if another audio channel is currently in
      use. In addition, YAM plays the sound now totally asyncron,
      which means the GUI doesn`t go to sleep while the sound is
      playing.

2004-01-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: modified the error checking routines of the POP3
      routines. This fixes a bug that caused YAM not reporting
      any error if the POP3 server immediatlely terminates the
      connection directly after an emitted connect.

2004-01-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: as promised before, I totally reworked the
      DIGEST-MD5 authentification routines. Previously it wasn`t
      working at all and now seems to perfectly conform to
      RFC 2831.
      Also exchanged the authentification priority to first check
      for a possible DIGEST-MD5 authentification as this type of
      authentification is per definition more secure than the
      CRAM-MD5 variant.

2004-01-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: reworked the whole SMTP AUTH routines to work
      more accurate according to their respectify RFC. This should
      also hopefully fix the newly introduced problems with the
      PLAIN and LOGIN authentification.
      During the tests on all authentification methods I also
      realized that the whole DIGEST-MD5 auth implementation seems
      to be broken by design. This really requires a complete
      rework as the current implementation doesn`t work at all like
      it should.

2003-12-29  Alexey Ivanov <amis@amiga.org.ru>

    * YAM_FO.c, YAM_MA.c, YAM_folderconfig.h added custom
      WriteIntro and WriteGreetings phrases for every folder.

2003-12-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_Cog.c: fixed the MakeInteger() function to
      generate a integer dependent string gadget with maxlen+1
      instead of just maxlen. This fixes flaw #862238.
    * Recipientstring.c: moved back the dipose of the Matchwindow
      to the OM_DISPOSE method because the MUIM_Cleanup method is
      also called upon an iconification request of the application.
      This caused enforcer hits when windows with existing
      recipientstring object has been iconfified by MUI. This
      fixes the reported bug #865081.

2003-12-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed recently introduced CRAM-MD5/DIGEST-MD5
      authentication bug, where YAM stripped too much of the
      received MD5 challenge ID which caused the authentification
      to fail on server which just return "\n" instead of "\r\n".

2003-12-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MI.c, YAM_RE.c: rewrote the base64 file decoding routines
      to use the new base64decode() implementation. This should not
      only increase the base64 MIME decoding a bit, it should also
      increase the security if something went wrong during the
      decoding phase.

2003-12-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MAf.c: fixed a recently introduced bug where the use of
      the new base64decode() function while decoding the transfer
      date from a file comment caused the mail structure to get
      overwritten. The new base64decode() routine does always
      set a final NUL-byte, so we had to use a larger buffer for
      the decoding.
    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_utilities.h: replaced the more or less
      short isSpace(), isGraph() and isAlNum() functions by
      macros which should perform a bit better.
    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_RE.c: replaced the MatchTT() stub function
      by direct calls to the MatchNoCase() function.
    * YAM_MI.c: removed obsolete from64txt() base64 decoding
      routine. The functionality is now fully covered by the
      new rfc2047 and base64decoding routines.
    * YAM_MAf.c, YAM_MI.c, YAM_RE.c: YAM wasn`t at all RFC 2047
      compliant and the decoding routines RE_ProcessHeader where
      way to crippled and recursive. I totally reworked the RFC
      2047 decoding routines and added them to YAM_MI.c where now
      a sophisticated callback function based mechanism is used
      to correctly decode and translate the charsets.
      Verified that correct function of the new routines with tons
      of mails and the examples from the RFC 2047 document. We
      should be RFC 2047 compliant now.

2003-12-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MAf.c: replaced the from64txt() call by a call to the
      new reworked base64decode() function. This allows to introduce
      a more sophisticated failure checking and probably also leads
      to a slightly increase of performance during index rescanning
      of large folders.
    * YAM_MI.c: started reworking the MIME encoding routines.
      Optimized the base64 string encoding/decoding functions to
      be a bit faster and also provide a better interface for
      error reporting during decoding/encoding phase. Adapted
      other sources to use the new reworked base64 string functions.

2003-12-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_COg.c: changed MUIA_Listview_ScrollerPos of translation
      table popup gadgets to carry a scrollbar at the right, instead
      of forcing the user to use his keys to scroll around.
      This was obvious the change AmiS wanted to achieve.
    * YAM_WR.c: reverted AmiS`s changes which were nonsense.

2003-11-27  AmiS <amis@amiga.org.ru>

    * YAM_WR.c: popup gadget of the translation table doesn`t support
      any scrollbar. Fixed.

2003-11-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed tiny flaws within the test parsing routines
      that caused YAM not to display any mail text if a message part
      had zero size.
      Also increased the error checking a bit so that error
      conditions while reading the data of a part are better checked.

2003-11-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed small bug where upon an occurred PGP Error the
      logfile has been deleted even if the error messages states to
      refer to that logfile.

2003-11-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * Recipientstring.c: fixed a possible enforcer hit on recipient
      string not having attached a FromString or ReplyTo string and
      were a recipient list had been inserted.
    * Recipientstring.c: changed the OM_DISPOSE method to be a
      MUIM_Cleanup method instead. This is necessary because the used
      macro _app(obj) is per definition only allowed within the context
      of MUIM_Setup/MUIM_Cleanup and could cause problems if used
      elsewhere.

2003-11-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MAf.c: enhanced the error checking functions within
      the index loading routines a bit.
    * YAM_CO.c: once again enhanced the gadgets enable/disable
      functionality of the filter action gadgets.

2003-11-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_CO.c: the action gadgets of the filter rules will now be
      ghosted as soon as the corresponding checkmark is disabled.

2003-11-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: added "7-bit" and "8-bit" to the recognizable transfer
      encoding strings as bugreport #771917 mentions cases where mail
      clients seem to send mail with transfer encoding strings of that
      type. However, even if "7-bit" and "8-bit" isn`t RFC 1521 compliant,
      it doesn`t harm to recognize these acronyms.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #834133 where a quote-printable encoded text
      was stripped if it contained a "=00" which caused the displayed
      text to contain a NUL byte.
      Now YAM will automatically replace these NUL-bytes within a
      displayable text by spaces, so that at least the text is correctly
      showed.

2003-10-03  AmiS <amis@amiga.org.ru>

    * Debug.h, Makefile.MorphOS, YAM_debug.h, includes/extra.h:
      improved MorphOS compilation.

2003-09-28  AmiS <amis@amiga.org.ru>

    * YAM_RE.c: Added autodetection of russian codepages and
      converting names of attached files to system codepage during
      saving them to disk. (Only for Codepage Autodetect/Translation = On)

2003-09-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MAf.c, YAM_UT.c: reworked the .index loading routines a bit
      to make them a bit more robust against not enough memory conditions
      or errors while loading the index files.

2003-08-29  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed the BusyText display while transfering data
      from a POP server. Now YAM will even show a message within the
      InfoBar that the transfer is in progress, even if the transfer
      window is disabled.
    * YAM_TR.c: fixed the Transfer Status routines once more. I forgot
      to make sure that the status display is updated correctly at
      least at the end of each mail transfer. That should make the
      whole transfer progress a bit smoother.

2003-08-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: reworked the Transfer Status routines once more to not only
      speed up the overall processing time while exporting mails. YAM
      will now update the TransferStatus only at a maximum of twice a
      second at every operation using the Transfer window.
      That increases now also the performance of the the POP3/SMTP transfers
      especially with fast connections that would update the transfer
      stats quite often. Tests have shown that this can decrease the
      overall transfer time by a factor of ~1.6.

2003-07-08  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

    * YAM_global.c: replaced the copyright symbol with "(C)" to be
      friendlier with charsets where this symbol is not available
    * classes/YAM.c: likewise
    * locale/YAM.cd: likewise

2003-07-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: applied a patch for the mail export functions of YAM which
      increase the performance of a export session by a factor of ten.
      The gauge refreshing routines took to much time from the whole
      export functionality, so YAM was busy with refreshing the GUI all
      the time. Thanks to Olaf Barthel for supplying this patch.

#### YAM 2.4p1 RELEASE ####################################################

2003-05-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c, YAM_WR.c: fixed a bug in the save routines for decrypting
      PGP messages. Previously YAM was not correctly saving a decrypted PGP
      message to a compressed folder.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug in PGP signed routines where YAM didn`t give the
      user the possibility to check the signature even if the message was
      correctly signed.

2003-05-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_TR.c, YAM_UT.c: fixed bug were a mail import to a compressed or
      encrypted folder didn`t work as expected. YAM simply didn`t save the
      mail compressed or encrypted, which caused some trouble later.

2003-05-23  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

    * YAM_MA.c, YAM.cd: replaced MSG_MA_CROPREQUEST_GADS with MSG_YesNoReq2
      to avoid reinventing the wheel every time. MSG_AB_NOYAMADDRBOOK_GADS
      should also be dropped in YAM2.5+ in favour of the new string.

2003-05-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c: fixed bug #730474 where YAM didn`t uniconfiy the application
      via a created MUI appicon if the HIDE option was used upon the
      startup.
    * YAM.c: fixed bug #727871 where it wasn`t possible to quit YAM while
      it was iconified and a confirmation requester need to pop up. Now
      YAM will automatically uniconify to request the user to answer to
      this requester before quitting. Only a "QUIT FORCE" arexx command will
      exit YAM the hard way and skipping all further user input while
      quitting.

2003-05-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug where the FOLDERINFO arexx command
      returned the wrong identifier for a "sent and received" folder
      type. Now FOLDERINFO will return the exact same id value for each
      folder like it is saved in the .fconfig file.
    * YAM_MA.c, YAM_RE.c, YAM_main.h, YAM.cd: added a warning requester to
      the attachment crop routines because otherwise people could loose
      attachments if they used that option on accident.

2003-05-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_FO.c: fixed bug #739139 where YAM didn`t refresh the mail listview
      upon a folder type change. Also the refresh was done slightly wrong
      which should be fixed now.
    * YAM_FO.c: fixed bug #729366 where YAM ignored the Cancel button of the
      password entry window while creating/changing a folder.
    * YAM_FO.c: fixed bug in the folder config loading routines where YAM
      always created a "outgoing" folder if the folder directory was missing
      while starting up.

2003-05-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_CO.c, YAM_COs.c, YAM_UT.c: as many people were confused by the
      fact that YAM 2.4 wasn`t automatically resizing the main listview
      columns anymore, a new hidden option "AutoColumnResize" to the .config
      file has been introduced.
      By default this variable will be set to Yes, to stop confusing people
      with the non autoresizing feature of YAM 2.4+. So, all those people out
      there whining about a slow folder switching if they have >1000 mails
      in their folders should now explicitly modify their .config file and
      use "AutoColumnResize = N" to stop YAM from using the autoresizing
      feature of NList which significantly slows down a NList refresh.
      Following that, those people should also know that they need to have
      their columns fixed if AutoColumResize is set to No.
    * YAM_UT.c: YAM will now suppress any DOS requester from popping up while
      trying to save the MUI object information to the ENVARC:mui/YAM.cfg file
      upon the exit of YAM. This should prevent people from whining about the
      fact that YAM wants to save the whole object information while quiting.
      Please note that YAM doesn`t only save the NList column widths in that file,
      but also saves information like the object weights informationm which is
      quite important for the layout manager of MUI.

2003-05-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c: the ASL_ATTACH filerequesters will now show a "~(#?.info)"
      pattern as default to make living with them a bit easier ;)
    * YAM_TR.c: fixed bug in MBOX export function where YAM didn`t correctly
      export & import file depending on the "mboxrd" specification found at
      http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/mbox.html

2003-05-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * fixed the temporary filename generation once more to generate real
      unique files depending on the YAM instance that is currently running
      and also fixed a bug where a tempfilename from OpenTempFile()
      shouldn`t be longer than SIZE_MFILE.

2003-05-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug in Popupmenu routines where the use of
      the "Export Message" item caused YAM to export all messages
      instead of just the selected one.
    * YAM_CO.c: fixed flaw in temporary filename specification for
      a new write window. Multiple instances of YAM used the same
      tempfile names for each write window and therefore interfered
      each other.
    * YAM_UT.c: fixed flaw within temporary file generation where we
      didn`t take in consideration that two YAM instances could
      use the same temporary files and therefore cause some trouble.

2003-04-29  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_WR.c: fixed bug #729651 where YAM tried to delete a .autosave*
      file even if AutoSave=0 was set in the configuration.

2003-04-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c: to make the whole AutoDST mechanism a bit more stable and
      also useable I reworked/fixed the whole GetDST() again.
      Also GetDST() now directly supports the ENV:FACTS/DST env variable
      to check for the current DST mode. So running FACTS with SummerTime
      emulation is not required anymore.
    * YAM.c: fixed bug in AutoDST recognition where YAM didn`t correctly
      recognize the SUMMERTIME environment variable because it provided
      a way too short buffer to GetVar().

2003-04-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_DI.c: fixed bug #728040 where the abbreviation string gadget
      was always reset to "-new-" even if the user didn`t confirm with
      pressing return.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #728162 where YAM didn`t quote any mail text
      upon a reply if the mail in question had an multipart attachment.

#### YAM 2.4 RELEASE ######################################################

2003-04-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed a serious bug in the RE_UndoPart() function
      where YAM didn`t correctly undo a specific part and put the
      wrong filename string in previous moved parts. This caused
      that some multipart attachments weren`t accessable.
    * YAM.c: replaced calloc()/free() calls for the TimerIO requests
      with better conforming AllocMem()/FreeMem() calls, because
      TimerIO requests need to be MEMF_PUBLIC allocated according to
      Gunther.

2003-04-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_COs.c: fixed bug #724594 where YAM didn`t save the
      separate SMTP port value at all to the configuration.

2003-04-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c: fixed bug #724394 where a opened bounce window caused
      some enforcer hits upon a AUTOSAVE timerequest. YAM didn`t
      take respect of the fact that a bounce window isn`t a full
      write window and therefore tried to access it in a wrong
      fashion.

2003-04-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MAf.c: fixed bug #720377 where the folderlist update
      routine did count the entries in the listtree wrong and
      therefore didn`t refresh some entries if some folder groups
      where closed.
    * YAM.c: fixed bug #715959 where a fast try to double start
      YAM caused a small enforcer hit.

2003-04-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c: fixed bug #721608 where a return value of NULL
      in the GetRealPath() function wasn`t quite a wise decision as
      GetRealPath is often used in string manipulation functions.

2003-04-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_FI.c: fixed bug #721041 where YAM caused some serious
      enforcer hits if a too long matchpattern was used together
      with ths substring option.

2003-04-14  David Rey <david@saug.org>

    * YAM_RE.c, YAM.cd: changed the shortcuts for the "Set status to
      marked/unmarked" menu items for them to be actually usable and
      added shortcuts for selecting no messages/toggle the selection.

2003-04-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c: fixed enforcer hit upon exit, where a not previously
      issued timerequest caused some trouble. Now everyting should
      work smoothy again.

2003-04-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c: added NotifyRequest mechanism to the AutoDST feature. Now
      YAM will automatically reparse a supported AutoDST environment
      variable as soon as it will be changed. This makes it possible
      to have a AutoDST system like "SetDST" running and as soon
      as this system alters the env variable, YAM will recheck this
      variable and change the DST settings accordingly. Now YAM should
      really be timezone&DST compatible like it should have been since
      ages ;)
    * YAM.c, YAM_CO.c: fixed the whole internal timerequest handling
      within YAM. Previously YAM did only use one single timerequest to
      handle the background management functions like automatic
      index saving, checking mail within a specified interval and auto
      backuping text that is currently in edit mode. YAM always issued
      a 1 second long timerequest and managed the mentioned methods by
      counting the time in own iterator variables. This caused a lot of
      overhead for the system and it is a much more cleaner approach to
      generate a single timerequest for each of this automatic interval
      methods. Now YAM will issue 3 different timerequests upon start
      without polling the system each second. Hopefully this increased
      the overall response because YAM doesn`t need to operate on a
      signal each single second.
    * YAM.c: fixed and enhanced the AutoDST facility. Now YAM also takes
      respect of the ENV:TZONE variable created by SetDST. It`s not
      completly finished yet, as we need some notification mechanism
      to signal YAM that the DST has changed.

2003-04-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_COg.c, YAM.cd: fixed bug #717880 and #717881 where we forgot
      to set a bubble help text and some shortcuts within the YAM
      configuration.
    * YAM_MA.c, YAM_MAf.c: fixed refresh bug where upon a index rescan
      the folderlisttree wasn`t correctly refreshed.
    * YAM_CO.c, YAM_COg.c, YAM_COs.c, YAM_ER.c, YAM_FI.c, YAM_MA.c,
      YAM_MAf.c, YAM_RE.c, YAM_TR.c, YAM_UT.c, YAM_WR.c, YAM_mainFolders.h,
      YAM_rexx_rxif.c, YAM_utilities.h:
      fixed the whole flawed timezone handling within YAM after I
      recognized that YAM couldn`t handle half-an-hour timezones and also
      the dates of the mails were saved within the local timezone to the
      .findex files. Now YAM doesn`t need the YAM_TZ env-variable anymore,
      because it can now also obtain half-an-hour timezone directly from
      Locale and all the timeinformation of a mail are saved in reference
      to UTC. This allows the user to switch timezones without having to
      rescan the whole indices. Please note that this change requires all
      indices to be rebuild, so that the dates are saved in UTC which
      YAM will later refer to. To make this index rescan automatic, I
      bumped the .findex version to YIN5.
      In addition to that fixes/changes, YAM should now also know all
      "well-known" timezone abbreviations. It will now also accept
      timezones which are specified in ISO8601 and accepts timezone
      abbreviations in the military format specified in RFC822.
      And as a special "bonus" the withdraw of the YAM_TZ variable seems
      to have caused that a index rescan processes about 20% faster
      than before because the mass GetVar() calls while index scanning
      are gone. All in all this whole timezone handling should be
      more stable/pratical as before and people using YAM within such a
      half-an-hour timezone should be happy now. ;)

2003-04-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c, YAM_UT.c: fixed bug in YAM_TZ env variable handling where
      upon a index rescan the environment variable was checked all the
      time and probably lead to some performance problems. Now the
      YAM_TZ variable will just be checked upon a YAM startup.

2003-04-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug in the headerline parsing routines where YAM did
      also display malformed headerlines (which doesn`t conform to RFC)
      and probably mixed up the headerline display within a read window.

2003-04-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug #715777 where the gauge while filtering upon new
      mails did show all and not only the new mails.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #706756 where every action within a read window
      triggered an automatic addition to the addressbook if the option was
      enabled within the configuration.

2003-03-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c: bumped minimum version for NList.mcc to v20.111 or otherwise
      we will confuse people using different versions and noticing speed
      differences.

2003-03-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MAf.c, YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #706760 where upon a read of a
      PGP encrypted message that couldn`t be decrypted cause YAM
      to not display the whole error message within the read window.
      Now also the readwindow will show the encrypted message as a
      seperate attachment to make it able to save this attachment.
      Also tried to make the whole PGP decrypting more robust.
    * YAM_FO.c: the FO_SaveConfig() function didn`t return the success
      status of the write operation which caused some troubles if
      a write operation failed somehow. Now all usages of FO_SaveConfig()
      should be more save.
    * YAM_CO.c: fixed bug #683672 where upon a reload of the default
      values within the TCP/IP configuration a enforcer hit was
      triggered.

2003-03-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_FI.c: fixed bug where a CloseRequest to a find window caused
      some enforcer hits if a search was actually running in that
      particular find window.
    * YAM_WR.c: removed the GroupFrame from the bouncing request window
      because it is not needed.
    * YAM_UT.c: omit the MUIA_Window_ID for the Attachment requester or
      otherwise the refering window attributes like RefWindow don`t work
      correctly and put the position of a attachment requester in relation
      to the read window.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug where a found PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK line was not
      displayed while viewing a mail.

2003-03-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed bug in the SMTP send routines where the new routines
      didn`t correctly find the message body and therefore stripped some
      lines on accident.
    * YAM_TR.c: fixed serious bug within the POP3 receive routines where
      a POP3 server that allowed transfers of binary data caused YAM to
      hang under certain situations i.e. a transfered NUL (ASCII 0) caused
      YAM to request too much data from the POP3 server and therefore
      hanged YAM completly.

2003-03-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c, YAM_RE.c, YAM_TR.c: fixed bug #433751 where the automatic
      deletion of mails triggered an AppIcon refresh for every deleted mail
      and therefore caused lots of flickering.
    * YAM_COs.c: fixed flaw where a "LetterPart = 0" config value always
      caused confusion on users upgrading from 2.3 to 2.4 because the old
      version did interpret the LetterPart a little bit different. If a
      user specified the LetterPart to be zero it could have happened that
      he wasn`t able to see any text on a forward or edit mail operation.
      Now YAM will always use 1 as the bare minimum for the Letterpart
      regardless of what the user specified there.
      This should explain bugreport #701002.

2003-03-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_WR.c, YAM_TR: fixed bug #701277 where YAM sent the email body
      with bare LFs which is prohibited by the RFC 2822 and therefore throw
      some errors on some pedantic SMTP servers (qmail).

2003-03-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #700608 where a missing "unsigned" definition
      caused the automatic display charset translation to fail. Now all
      charset converters should work as expected again.

2003-03-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * classes/Addrmatchlist.c: fixed bug where multiple recipientstrings
      within one window didn`t correctly refresh the addrmatchlist
      position.
    * classes/Recipientstring.c: fixed bug where a recipientstring allowed
      to Advance to the next object even if the user entered a non-existent
      alias. Now the string should stay active and in addition to that
      present the user a DisplayBeep().

2003-03-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c: added developer version expiration requester that will be
      presented to the user if he uses that compiled version for more than
      one month. This should minimize the problems with users using old
      developer versions we can`t build our bugreports on.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #680450 where attachment filesnames were always
      truncated to 32bytes. Now YAM should leave it to the filesystem
      to support longer filenames or not. This should also fix the
      truncation of attachment (file)names on a mail forward.
    * YAM.c: fixed bug #555698 where a missing .folders file caused some
      enforcer hits because a folder wasn`t actually selected as active.
    * classes/Recipientstring.c: added workaround for buggy Betterstring.mcc
      behaviour. Betterstring.mcc`s OM_GET method is broken and doesn`t
      return the correct MUIA_String_AdvanceOnCR value. Therefore we catch
      the attribute ourself and return it to the caller accordingly.
    * YAM_TR.c, YAM_RE.c, YAM_WR.c: fixed serious flaw within the mail
      parsing and transfer routines where YAM didn`t take respect of
      binary data could being transfered/parsed. All main parsing
      function did use fgets() and string function which could have
      caused trouble if the file/mail had null bytes within. Now
      all major routines take respect of that.
      Also reworked the Encoding test routines to pick the correct
      transfer type encoding depending on previous analyzes of the parsed file.
      This fixes bug #685826.
    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_global.c, YAM_global.h: added new common ContentType
      "application/pdf" to internal YAM types as this one is quite common
      and should be included in YAM.

2003-03-07  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * classes/InfoBar.c/ShowGauge: fixed an ancient and serious bug in
      SetAttrs() call - TAG_DONE was missing...
      (Since SAS/C inlines such calls the problem was hidden. However,
      with GCC a stub function is used and thus important additional data
      is placed infront of the taglist [saved registers and return address]
      which accidently gets "part" of the taglist causing havoc)

2003-03-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug in MAILINFO arexx command where the
      stem variable didn`t return the 32bit checksum value in the correct
      format. Now the stem will return it as the correct 32bit hexvalue
      like it is saved within the .index file.
    * YAM.c, YAM_UT.c: fixed bug in xget() wrapper function where we
      forgot to set the destination variable to zero which caused the
      CheckMCC() function to fail if a .mcc didn`t had the
      MUIA_Version/Revision attributes.
    * YAM_FO.c: fixed bug #696732 where we used a incorrect locale text
      for the mailinglist signature help bubbles.
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug #697501 where the "Set status to" context menu
      items weren`t correctly disabled anymore.
    * YAM_MA.c, YAM_MAf.c, YAM_main.h, YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #697407
      where the whole volatile/permanent flag functionality was broken.
      Reworked the whole mechanism and in addition to a better design,
      the MAILINFO arexx command also takes respect of the new marked
      message flag now.

2003-03-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c: reworked own YAMMUIRequest() function a bit to work more
      accurate like the original MUI_Request() function. Also these changes
      remove the maximum value of 32 buttons per requester. Now a requester
      can have nearly unlimited buttons.

2003-02-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug where on a use of PGPv5 a unknown keyid wasn`t
      correctly identified. Damn, this whole PGP stuff really needs a
      complete rework soon.
    * YAM_UT.c: replaced redundant CompNoCase() function with a call to
      strnicmp() which anyway does the same.
    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_FI.c: increased the sizes of all buffers used with
      ParsePattern() to at least 2*sourcelen+2, as proposed in the
      dos autodocs. This should probably fix problems with hugh used
      pattern fields that caused a buffer overrun within ParsePattern().

2003-02-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_WR.c: removed the autoactivate of the To: string gadget again
      as it seems that one activation upon a write window open is enough.
    * classes/Recipientstring.c: fixed bug in HandleEvent() method where
      a recipientstring did always eat all RAWKEY events, even if they
      were not handled by the string itself. That caused an active string
      not to forward hotkey events to the window.

2003-02-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c, YAM_MA.c YAM_RE.c: removed all Toolbar qualifier bugs
      workarounds and made the new upcoming version v15.8 the minimum
      requirement for YAM as all known bugs should be removed within
      this final version. All those workarounds in YAM caused more troubles.

2003-02-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c: fixed bug in AppendToBuffer() function where we forgot
      to terminate a string with a '\0' and therefore sometimes got
      back unterminated string which could have caused problems later on.

2003-02-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * added seperate contextmenu for the titlebar of the MailList and
      FolderList. Now a user can directly enable/disable columns by
      using the RMB in front of the NList titlebar.
    * replaced the popupmenu.library based contextmenus with better
      integrateable MUI based contextmenus. This allows to separate the
      contextmenu in two different areas - one for the title and one
      for the rest of the listview. Also contextmenus are now possible
      even if the user hasn`t got popupmenu.library installed.
      Now YAM doesn`t require/use popupmenu.library anymore which is a
      bit more "natural" for a MUI application.

2003-02-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_mail_lex.l: reworked the textstyle highlighting regular
      expressions to work more accurate and also allow to stylish text
      passages with only one character. That fixes bug #683385.

2003-02-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_mail_lex.l: fixed tiny bug in the text highlighting routines
      where after a URL in a quoted text part, the color information
      was lost.
    * YAM_CL.c: changed the TextEditor WheelMouse support to scroll
      up/down by a value of 1/6 of the displayed text. Let`s see if
      this is the value most people can live with :)

2003-02-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * classes/Addrmatchlist.c, classes/Recipientstring.c: changed the
      Recipientstring and it`s matchwindow to support selection via
      the mouse including the possibility to use the wheel to scroll
      up/down in the addrmatchlist. This also fixes bug #645653.
    * YAM_WR.c: changed writewindow to automatically select the
      To string gadget as the active object upon a selection of the
      first page.

2003-02-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * classes/Addrmatchlist.c: if the window that the addrmatchlist was
      displayed in had been moved while the matchlist was open, the next
      time it opened at the wrong position.
    * YAM_CL.c: added Wheelmouse support to own TextEditor subclass. As
      the original TextEditor doesn`t support the newmouse
      NM_WHEEL_UP/DOWN codes, YAM catches this codes on it`s own now and
      sends the slider the correct commands to scroll down/up.

2003-02-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c: changed array MUIM_NList_Insert call to use the newly
      introduced MUIV_NList_Insert_Flag_Raw flag. This flag allows to
      insert data into a NList without reevaluating the NList`s column
      width on each insert operation and therefore speeds up the insertion.
      This new flag is only available if NList.mcc v20.109 or higher is
      used. If a lower version is used, YAM will simply display the mail
      listview with the old speed :)
      Tests have shown that together with this new flag it is possible to
      insert ~8000 elements in around 1-2 sec. instead of 8-9 seconds
      previously.

2003-02-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #678206 where YAM did strip the signature separator
      upon a mail edit.

2003-02-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: The read window will also take respect of the newly
      introduced marked flag now.
    * supportfiles/icons: Now the 16color Iconset is the new default set
      for YAM. Moved the old and partly outdated 8colors images to std8col
      subdirectory.
    * YAM_RE.c: A mail that is actually displayed within the read window
      can now easily be set to "marked" by using a new introduced readwindow
      menu item.
    * added an additional "marked" mail flag to YAM. Now it is possible to
      set the status of a mail to "Marked" which causes YAM to set a
      special flag to that mail. If a mail is then flagged as "marked",
      YAM will try to highlight this certain mail within the Mail Listview.
      If a new image file "status_mark" is present within the PROGDIR:Icons
      directory, YAM will use this image within the Listview as an additional
      status icon. If this new image file is missing, YAM will simply highlight
      this message by displaying the Senders name with bold letters.
      Also the Status sorting routines take respect of that new "marked" flag
      now, which makes it possible to better sort that marked mails.
      This new flag should make it possible for the user to highlight
      certain mails for later reference, like it is common with other mail
      programs. Please note that YAM will use the mailfile comment field to
      save the flag informatin permanently, if the index needs to be rebuild.

2003-02-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_FO.c: removed the extra Foldername Requester as it caused more
      confusion concerning the Path and Directory settings of a folder.
      Now the user can directly specify the correct folder path within
      the general folder configuration. Also enhanced Warning requesters
      concerning the existance of a folder. Now it should be more intuitive
      to change/set a foldername and path. This also fixed bug #571768.

2003-01-31  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_CL.c: YAM will now insert the famous multilinedelete replacement
      text snippet "[...]" if the user marked whole lines and presses
      RAMIGA+DEL within the Write window. This tiny text snippet is used
      quite often in mailinglists and signals the reader that a whole bunch
      of lines have been deleted in the replied text. Previously a user
      had to add this "[...]" snippet on his own, but now YAM inserts it
      automatically if the user deletes those lines with RAMIGA+DEL.

2003-01-29  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_mail_lex.l: fixed bug #674998 where a empty mailbody caused
      YAM to not refresh the read window or even hang the whole
      application.

2003-01-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_mail_lex.l: the new syntax highlighter didn`t center lines that
      starts with <sb> anymore.

2003-01-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug where the SaveDisplay functionality did save
      the same headerline more than once to the resulting file if it
      was wrapped within the header display.

2003-01-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_mail_lex.l: modified the regular expressions of the text scanner
      once more to be more accurate in finding the end of a URL and Email
      address in the text. This fixed bug #671394.

2003-01-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_mail_lex.l: slightly optimized the regular expressions to be
      more accurate in finding the correct tokens.

2003-01-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug #667194 where a reply or forward of a "virtual"
      mail caused an enforcer hit.
    * YAM_CO.c, YAM_COs.c, YAM_COg.c: added additional color selection
      gadgets for the 1st, 3rd and 4th level quotes. Now the user can select
      different colors for each quoting level. In addition to that also
      the used colored for highlighting URLs is now user configurable within
      the YAM config. This shows how powerfull the new preparsing routines
      are.
    * YAM_RE.c: removed the RE_ExtractURL() function and replaced it with
      a own function that also uses the lexical analyses functions
      introduced recently. This should also make the search for URL
      passages much more precise within YAM.
    * disabled the use of all MUIV_TextEditor_ImportHook_EMail within YAM
      because the internal E-mail importhook of TextEditor seems to be
      way to buggy to allow it to crash YAM anymore.
      As a replacement I implemented own text preparsing routines to highlight
      text passages. This routines are mainly based on the flex tool which
      generates own, fast and reliable lexical analyses. Now YAM should not
      only run more stable, it should also be more precise in highlighting
      URLs, using textstyles such as *bold* /italic/ and so on and it should
      probably also be a bit faster.
      Please note that you now need at least flex v2.5 to correctly compile
      YAM out of the box. One more advantage of this flex mechanism is, that
      we can now exactly specify text areas that should be highlighted with
      the use of regular expressions (flex format). This makes the whole
      engine more powerful and precise.

2003-01-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_COs.c: added dozen of "else if" instead of simple "if" statements
      to the config loading routines of YAM. That should speed up the config
      loading very significant.
    * YAM_RE.c: removed MUIM_TextEditor_ClearText calls because they seem
      to be one of the reasons why some emails crash if the Next/Prev
      functionality is used.

2003-01-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug #658937 where a MAILSUBJECTCHANGE arexx command
      did trash some memory if a subject larger than SIZE_SUBJECT has
      been used.
    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c, YAM_TR.c: fixed bug #659733 where the MAILCHECK
      arexx command did set the <stem>.OnServer variable not correctly.
      Previously it was just set to the amount of mails before the
      occured download, but now it correctly just shows the remaining
      mails after the download. Also recognized/fixed that after a download
      of 0 mails, the LastDL struct wasn`t set correctly, which also caused
      the MAILCHECK command to return RC 5, which wasn`t quite correct at all.
    * YAM_MAf.c: changed MA_ExamineMail() function to not use a static
      buffer for operation. That caused bug #657352 and probably was also
      the reason for some strange behaviour somewhere. Before that fix
      it was unsafe to use MA_ExamineMail() twice in a row, because the
      second call would have deleted the results of the first one.

2003-01-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #658683 where the APPBUSY arexx command
      required some text. Now you can simply call APPBUSY without any
      option and YAM will only set the application to sleep without
      placing any text in the busy region.
    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #658259 where YAM didn`t resolve names
      or aliases if they belonged to a distribution list.
    * YAM_AB.c, YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #658175 where it was
      possible that a wrong birthdate definition was passed
      through the ADDREDIT command and throwed an enforcer hit.
      Now the command returns an RC 10 code if something is wrong with
      the supplied birthdate number. In case a zero is supplied
      to the ADDREDIT command, YAM will delete the current set
      birthdate accordingly.
    * YAM_RE.c: YAM now also correctly recognized pgp signed
      messages that begin with "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE" and
      flags this messages as "signed".

2002-12-25  David Rey <david@saug.org>

    * YAM_rexx_rxcl.c: the INFO template was still wrong.

2002-12-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_rexx_rxif.c: changed the bugfix of
      bug #596303 on user demand. Previously YAM
      did always put the Application to sleep if the Busy()
      function was used. This made the usability of the
      application a bit too annoying. Now we just put
      the application to sleep (showing a busy pointer) if
      the APPBUSY arexx command will be used.

2002-12-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_DI.c: fixed bug where the listview wasn`t always
      in sync with the current Abbreviature text.

2002-12-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c/MA_GetRealSubject(): fixed bug where YAM didn`t
      correctly return the real subject if a subject line with
      brackets hadn`t got any whitespace between the last
      bracket and the real subject line. Also slightly optimized
      the function a bit.

2002-12-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c/Busy(): fixed bug #596303 and brought back the
      MUIA_Application_Sleep calls to make the Busy() function work
      again like in 2.3. These calls doesn`t seem to harm the
      performance anymore (at least with MUI 3.9) like described in
      bug #458521. And if so, this is more a problem of old MUI
      versions and not ours.

2002-12-04  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: (TC_Dispatcher) reformat loops (no code change),
      (Terminate,Initialise,main): use <= MAXWR, (SendWaitingMail): simplify
    * YAM_UT.c: (SPrintF) use va_list for non-MorphOS case too

2002-12-03  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_UT.c/YAMMUIRequest: use do/while loop, correct type of return
      value for MUIM_Application_NewInput
    * YAM.c/DoStartup: use do/while loop
    * YAM_CL.c/BC_Dispatcher: improve data->BCD handling
    * YAM.c/Initialise: use MAXWR+1 as loop count when initialising notify
      requests, main: move local variables to better scopes, fix signal mask
      (notsig2 was never waited for!), merged separate notifyrequest handling
      into one loop, StayInProg: simplify
    * YAM_UT.c/PlaySound: fix warning #120 almost without a cast,
      LoadBCImage: fix and simplify
    * YAM.c,YAM_DI.c,YAM_MAf.c,YAM_RE.c,YAM_TR.c: remove superfluous test
      before FreeStrBuf()
    * YAM_utilities.h/FreeStrBuf: use sizeof() instead of hardcoded constant

2002-12-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_CL.c: replaced multiple set() call to the same object
      with a single SetAttrs() call.

2002-12-02  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_COs.c/CO_LoadConfig: constified sortconv[]
    * YAM.c,YAM_UT.c: use EasyRequestArgs()
    * YAM.c: suppress warnings for TimerBase (different casts),
      use MAXICONS as loop count in SetupAppIcons()
    * YAM_UT.c/ExpandText: move chr[] to its usage scope
    * YAM_WR.c/WR_AddArchiveFunc: likewise
    * YAM_UT.c/(RemoveCut,IdentifyFileDT): fixed wrong static usage,
      remove unused dead code (Index), stylistic changes
    * YAM_UT.c/AllocStrBuf: use size_t as argument type
    * YAM_UT.c/StrBufCpy,StrBufCat: adapt to that change
    * YAM_rexx_rxif/rx_addrresolve: remove cast of AllocStrBuf argument
    * YAM_UT.c/AllocCopy,CompressMailFile,UncompressMailFile,CheckPrinter,
      IdentifyFileDT: miscellaneous changes
    * YAM_CL.c/BC_Dispatcher: remove test in case of MUIA_Bodychunk_UseOld
    * YAM_FO.c/FO_MLAutoDetectFunc: fixed potential enforcer hits
    * YAM_UT.c/StrBufCpy,StrBufCat: optimized

2002-12-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c/YAM_MA.c: fixed bug #635892 where
      the GETSELECTED arexx command returns wrong values
      on a use at empty folders or if a folder group was
      actually active.

2002-11-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * includes/SDI_compiler.h: added REGARGS define for MorphOS
    * Makefile/Makefile.MorphOS: added $(CPU) to LDFLAGS

2002-11-27  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_MAf.c/FO_SetCurrentFolder: fix wrong NULL usage
    * classes/Recipientstring.c: fix wrong NULL usage, drop superfluous
      strlen()
    * classes/YAM.c: fix wrong NULL usage, changed casts in
      EMailCacheNode handling
    * includes/inline/amissl_protos.h: added
    * includes/extra.h: add prototype for strdup (VBCC, STORM3)
    * classes/ClassesExtra.h: add extra.h
    * extrasrc/access.c, extrasrc/strdup.c: add
    * all_vbcc.c, all_storm.c: use it
    * all_gcc.c: disable runtime CTRL-C checking
    * Makefile: fixes and cleanup
    * VMakefile: updated

2002-11-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * includes/proto/amissl.h,includes/proto/genesis.h,includes/proto/miami.h,
      includes/proto/muimaster.h,includes/proto/openurl.h,includes/proto/pm.h,
      includes/proto/socket.h,includes/proto/xpkmaster.h: re-established VBCC
      support
    * includes/clib/socket_protos.h: add define for htons if its missing
    * YAM.c/CheckMCC: reduced stack usage and simplified it

2002-11-21  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * includes/clib/socket_protos.h: usage of sys/types.h removed
    * YAM_UT.c/CRC32: replaced dynamic CRCTable with a static const one
    * YAM_utilities.h: removed prototype for FreeCRCTable
    * YAM.c/Terminate: removed FreeCRCTable call
    * smakefile: corrected CFLAGS and LNKFLAGS

2002-11-13  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: wrap SetupDebug() into DB()
    * classes/YAM.c, classes/Recipientstring.c: use DB wrapper
    * YAM_FO.c, YAM_RE.c: no stray ";" dueto DB statements
    * Debug.h: remove empty D/SetupDebug definitions

2002-11-13  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: don't call Terminate() inside the exitfunc on a premature exit
    * YAM_MAf.c: use alignment headers

2002-11-08  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: removed "struct Device *TimerBase"
    * YAM_global.c: added it here
    * YAM_find.h: define FORMAT_DEF if its not defined

2002-10-31  AmiS <amis@amiga.org.ru>

    * Added analyse "x-senderinfo" fields and and automatically
      translate them to system codepage if "Codepage Autodetect/Translation"
      option is turn on. Mainly for cyrillic users.

2002-10-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #625377 where YAM displayed the
      first message part of a mail even if it were recognized as
      a non printable part. Remember, only the first part in
      a message will be considered the "real" message if it
      is in a printable format, if not it is recognized as
      an attachment.
    * YAM_RE.c, YAM_MA.c: fixed a possible buffer overrun
      in the DisplayHook of the Attachment requester.
      Also fixed a possible problem with attachments which
      included "%" chars - some sprintf() drove crazy because
      of it ;)

2002-10-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c: YAM_UT.c, YAM_MA.c: had to remove the LEN_DATSTRING
      from the allocations for the buffer of DateToStr() again
      and extended those buffers to 32bytes each as OS3.1 doesn`t
      seem to respect it anyhow, if used with FORMAT_DEF.
      What happend was, that in case that a .country file was used
      with returning date strings longer than LEN_DATSTRING,
      OS3.1 just overwrote our own buffers and YAM ended up in weird
      crashes. In fact this only happened with the standard
      OS3.1 italia and portugal country files as those are the only
      two that could return datestrings longer than LEN_DATESTRING.

2002-10-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_MA.c: changed buffer allocation
      constants to use the LEN_DATSTRING defined symbol
      for better clarifications in those sections.

2002-10-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_COg.c: fixed bug #624953 where YAM did provide
      the %h variable option for the reply texts in the
      configuration window where this feature isn`t quite
      possible or reasonable.

2002-10-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c, YAM_FI.c: changed the DisplayHook of the Mail
      Listview and FindWindowListview to be a NList_DisplayHook2
      so that we are able to distingush between them. We actually
      just use one Hook for both windows and this made it
      necessary to be able to distingush for some reason, like
      which column should be displayed in which window aso.
      Also added the Received/Sent date column to the findwindow
      as it seems to be of some use.
    * YAM_RE.c: reworked the Next/Prev Thread routines a bit and
      made them first search the folder of the refering mail we are
      searching from. If no followup could have been found in this
      folder, YAM will prompt the user if he really wants to
      load other index files to scan other folders. This should make
      the searching for the next/prev thread remarkable faster and
      also hopefully safer.
      Please note that there still exists the flaw that a message
      could have more than one followup to it and that YAM actually
      just search for the first followup and then immediatly displays
      the message.
    * YAM_UT.c: fixed bug in the AllFolderLoaded() function where
      YAM didn`t also check the last folder in the list.

2002-10-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * added the possibility to correctly display/sort messages
      by the date they were received/sent. Previously YAM lacked
      to correctly save and display messages if they were sorted
      by "date received".
      To fix that lack, YAM now also saves the received date
      within the .index files of the folders and in addition to
      that also within the file comment as a base64 encoded string.
      This is necessary to make it possible to rescan the index
      without loosing the exact received/sent date after the scan.
      Also it is now possible to display the sent/received date
      within the mail listview by selecting "Date Sent/Received"
      from the config [Lists] tab.
      Please note that with this new feature/bugfix it is
      _necessary_ to do a complete rescan of the .index files of
      your folders.
      This should normally automatically be covered by the last
      index version update to YIN4 - if you used a version in
      between of this two changes you will end up with "corrupt index"
      warnings which should easily be solved by doing a manual
      rescan.

2002-10-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MAf.c, YAM.c: reworked the index loading/rescanning
      routines a bit to work a bit safer.
    * YAM_COg.c: changed Layout of NewMail/Download MUI group
      a bit and disabled the automatic ghosting of the WarnSize
      gadget to make more clear that this WarnSize is not only
      dependend to the Preselection gadget.

2002-10-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c, YAM_FI.c, YAM_UT.c: changed all DateTime FORMAT_DOS
      usages to FORMAT_DEF ones. This allows YAM to preferable
      use the Locale preferences for displaying the Date in
      the Mail listview and other areas.

2002-10-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: reworked the mailheader parsing a bit to make
      things more clear and faster.
    * YAM_MAf.c: fixed bug where YAM didn`t correctly connect
      multiline headers and stripped too many spaces.
    * YAM.c: fixed bug where on a fresh start of YAM the mail
      listview was out of sync with the folderlisttree and caused
      some weird enforcer hits if the first folder in the listtree
      wasn`t actually the INCOMING folder.

2002-10-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c, YAM_read.h: replaced the numerical constants for
      the HeaderModes of the Readwindow with some more descriptive
      Symbols of "enum HeaderMode".
    * YAM_RE.c: added "[" and "]" to the allowed characters
      within a URL. This should fix problems with URLs that
      contain these characters somehow.
      Please note that placing URLs in braces like
      "[http://www.test.de/]" within a mail isn`t really a good
      idea and we count this as a user fault ;)

2002-10-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * replaced YAM_hook.h with more standarized SDI_hook.h and
      also changed the inlcude statements accordingly.
      Also updated the SDI_compiler.h to newest version.

2002-10-07  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * YAM_RE.c: Don't try to use PGP if it's not installed

2002-10-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed bug #588099 where YAM didn`t automatically
      download new mail if the "DownloadLarge" option was
      disabled within the configuration.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #617855 where YAM showed an message part
      text within the readwindow even if "Read/Show all Texts"
      was disabled in the config and the user somehow "decoded"
      the message part by selecting display or save.
    * YAM_UT.c: replaced rudimentary ComprMsgID() algorithm with
      a more unique CRC32 checksum algorithm to give the Next/Prev
      Thread function more power in finding the correct follow-up
      Message. This fixes some problems where YAM did find the
      incorrect message on a Next/Prev Thread.
      NOTE: Please note that because of this different checksum
      calculation routines, all index files of the folders have to
      be recalculated. That`s why the .index ID was increased to
      "YIN4" so that next time you open your folders YAM should
      automatically renew the index file.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug where on a FollowUp with Next/Prev Thread
      YAM didn`t correctly changed the folder and sometimes showed
      weird data.

2002-10-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c: dropped the idea of resorting the listview on
      a mailstatus change within a sorted by status listview
      again. It seems that ppl just lost track of the messageview
      somehow.

2002-09-29  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c, YAM_FO.c, YAM_UT.c: fixed bug #596302
      where the FOLDERINFO and GETFOLDERINFO arexx command still
      worked somehow on foldergroups. Also fixed the indexing
      behaviour of FOLDERINFO aswell as the foldertype
      specification.
    * YAM_FO.c: fixed bug #589038 where on a folderlist reset,
      the listtree didn`t show the foldericons afterwards and
      didn`t correctly freed the previous images.
    * YAM_FO.c: fixed bug where after a creation of a new folder,
      YAM did always show the foldergroup icon in front of the new
      folder.

2002-09-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c: fixed bug in the BusyText functions where YAM didn`t
      restore the correct previous text on a BusyEnd;
    * YAM_MA.c: YAM didn`t clear the listview if the user issued
      a index rescan. That caused some corrupt listview display
      if the user scrolled around the listview if the rescan was
      still underway.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #595017 where YAM didn`t switch to the
      correct folder and highlighted the message if a SwitchMessage()
      (Next/Prev) was done in a readwindow with a mail whos
      folder wasn`t actually active.
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed flaw where YAM did loose the track of
      messages in a readwindow when the listview was sorted by
      status and the user wanted to use Next/Prev to read other
      messages. Now YAM will not resort the listview if the
      message is currently displayed in a readwindow.

2002-09-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug where YAM didn`t resort the mail
      listview if it was selected to be sorted by status and
      the status changed somehow.
    * YAM_MA.c: changed the status sorting priorities back again
      to just take the real mail status (New/Unread/Read aso.) and
      the importance of the mail in account for sorting the mails
      or otherwise a sorting by status&date would be kinda
      confusing. For more detailed description refer to the affected
      source code parts.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed another bug within the MIME Viewer parts
      of YAM were the argument of the MIME Viewer needed some
      extra attention concerning quotation marks. Now YAM should
      be able to execute the mime viewer correctly even if the
      path to the file has some whitespaces in it. It will also
      take care of the variant if the user already used quotation
      marks within the MIME configuration.

2002-09-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c, YAM_CO.c, YAM_FI.c, YAM_MA.c, YAM_UT.c, YAM_WR.c,
      YAM_utilities.h: fixed bug #610607 where mails in a
      PROGDIR: located folder were unable to display the RAW part.
      YAM was just forwarding PROGDIR: to the third party program
      where then this programs tried to find the mailfile out of
      PROGDIR: which obviously wasn`t correct. Now YAM will always
      do a Lock()/NameFromLock()/UnLock() to get out the
      correct path to the file before executing a third party
      program (mime viewer).

2002-09-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed bug #601755 where YAM showed the overall
      transfered bytes in the transferwindow always doubled by
      the amount of mails downloaded.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #598715 where YAM didn`t display the
      letter part of a message if the user deselected "Display
      All Texts" within the Read configuration and if the
      message was a multiple MIME encoded message were we had
      to "undo" some message parts because of different msg
      boundaries. YAM wasn`t reorganizing the msg part numbers
      on a UndoPart operation and therefore lost the sync of
      the message parts somehow. This fix should perhaps also
      automatically fix some other strange behaviour were some
      MIME parts were undoed by YAM.

2002-09-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_COg.c: fixed bug #600543 where YAM will now ghost the
      according string gadget if the preselection mode doesn`t
      require any size input

2002-09-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MAf.c: fixed bug #586671 in the folder index rescan
      routines where it could have happened that on copying
      a valid mail file into a mailfolder without YAM causes YAM to
      show up 2 equal mail files in the listview. This was caused
      because the rescan routine deleted the .index file while
      rescanning which caused YAM to loose the dirtree somehow.

2002-08-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug where the temporary unpack files weren`t
      deleted if the message was just switched within the same
      read window.
    * YAM_UT.c: fixed bug where it could have happened that
      YAM deleted the temporary unpack files (.unp) too early
      which resulted in some missbehaviour. For instance it was
      impossible to display the raw message part of a message
      that was located within a compressed folder.

2002-07-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c: reworked the FormatSize() function once more to
      now show sizes as a base of 2 for the fraction modes.
      Please note that this function will round the value
      depending on the selected precision mode - so i.e.
      102397 bytes is "100,0 KB", but "99,997 KB".
      Also slightly improved the overall performance of the
      function itself.

2002-07-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug where the SHOW arexx command
      didn`t work as expected directly after a start of YAM with
      the HIDE option.
    * classes/YAM.c: fixed bug #583098 where the emailcache
      didn`t seem to work correctly as it should. Somehow it didn`t
      add new entries to the file, and if then not to the
      correct position. Now it should always add new entries to
      the top of the list like a FILO.
      Also added some security check to the load function of the
      emailcache so that it will not read more lines than 100. In
      addition now YAM will also correctly free the whole list on
      exit.

2002-07-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed behaviour of the transfer status of the
      Transferwindow where the Gauge never really reached 100%
      even if the mail was finished.
    * YAM_TR.c: YAM didn`t issue any error message under certain
      situations while sending a mail. Now YAM should pop up a proper
      error message to signal the user that the connection was broken
      somehow.

2002-07-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_CO.c: fixed bug #580961 where the default AppIcon Label
      wasn`t localized at all.
    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #580964 where the ADDRDELETE
      arexx command had deleted the active entry if the command
      was called with an entry that didn`t exists in the ABook
      at all. Now the command will return a WARN(5) code if the
      entry wasn`t found.

2002-07-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c: added an additional check to the new CheckMCC
      function that will allow also broken .mcc to pass the
      test if the library version matches the one requested.
      In the particular example Toolbar.mcc is broken which
      will result in a a requester that requests the same
      version that we were searching for.
    * YAM_utilities.h: fixed bug #580966 where we lost the
      "Displayed Text" option within the save and print
      attachment requesters because of some screwed up
      flags.
    * YAM.c, YAM_MA.c, YAM_MAf.c, YAM_TR.c, YAM_UT.c,
      classes/InfoBar.c: fixed bug #557910 where the status
      icon of the infobar wasn`t in sync with the one in the
      folder listtree. Now they both should always show the
      same icon depending on the status.
      Please note that this fix could lead to additional
      flickering within the Listtree, which is a NList.mcc
      bug that is fixed within version 20.107+.

2002-07-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: added some general flags for the ->Status
      flags used within the preselection routines to make it
      easier to track down the purpose of some operations.
    * YAM_MA.c, YAM_MAf.c: changed the displayhook of the
      folder listtree and mail listview to skip certain
      operations if the user didn`t select any of the colums
      where this operations will be performed. This should
      slightly increase performance on that listviews.
    * YAM_UT.c: fixed bug #579202 where we used the wrong
      separator character for the precision sizes within the
      mail listview.
      Also fixed another bug within the FormatSize() function
      where it didn`t format sizes correctly. Now it should work
      as expected.
    * YAM_CO.c: fixed a small bug in the filter configuration
      page, where on a change from/to a Remote-Filter the
      Cycle gadget of the filter rule wasn`t notified and
      therefore showed some weird data.

2002-07-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: modified the ExtractURL function once more
      to be a bit more precise on recognizing email addresses.
      Now it should really only recognize proper email adresses
      and not any word that contains a "@".

2002-07-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: reworked the DoubleClickFunc of the Readwindow
      a bit to make it work more precise on the word the user
      really has double clicked on. This will make it possible
      for the user to double lick on two URL in the same line
      with having two separate actions to occur.
    * YAM_RE.c: Made the ExtractURL code within the ReadMessage
      functions a bit safer and also added normal email addresses
      to the recognition also. Now normal email addresses without
      a mailto: will not only be clickable within the readwindow
      they will also be highlighted like other clickable links.

2002-07-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: Undecoded message part sizes will now also be shown
      directly within the Readwindow with the ~ sign, like within
      the attachment window. This should make it more clear that the
      size of the message part isn`t known yet and that this is just
      a approximation.
    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: changed the INFO arexx command to
      require the ITEM attribute and return an error as stated
      in the arexx documentation. This fixes bug #555127
    * YAM_FO.c: fixed another enforcer hit within the ML-Autodetect
      functions that occured if only one mail was in a folder.
      This should hopefully fix this whole autodetect thing now.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed the doubleclick on mailto: functions once
      again and now it should also recognize ?subject= attributes
      and as a special bonus I also added support for cc= and bcc=
      as defined in the HTML standard.
      It will also try to figure out "&amp;" as the separator
      between attributes. With that I recognized that also the ";"
      was missing within the legal chars of a URI because a valid
      URI can also be something like:
      "mailto:a@b.c?subject=test&amp;cc=b@c.d"
    * YAM_WR.c: reverted the Hotkeys for the Menushortcuts of
      the write window back to use CommandStrings, so that they
      will not interfere with the same hotkeys for other gadgets.

2002-07-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_FO.c: reworked the whole "Autodetect"
      feature for MLs once more and hopefully now it will be
      stable and doesn`t crash at all. Also found and fixed
      a bug within the SWS string functions. This should fix
      bug #555125 and #557784.
    * YAM_COg.c, YAM_COs.c: changed the location of the
      "New Group for addrbook entries" string gadget and added
      a MUIA_Disabled relation to the above cycle gadget to better
      point out that this two options are belonging together.
    * YAM_RE.c: the designated addressbook group for new
      automatic added entries didn`t work correctly - fixed now.
      This should fix bug #528082, even if we have to mention
      that this group will only be used if a address is added
      automatically as soon as the user reads a message.
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug #431549 where it was possible to
      interrupt a transfer by trying to use the "Check Version"
      menuitem within the Main menu.
    * YAM_MA.c: the "Show last message" menuitem will now
      be disabled by default after a startup of YAM if there
      are no pending errors somehow.
    * YAM_ER.c: fixed bug #431550 where the activation of
      the error window via the Menuitem "Show last message"
      caused a actual transfer to abort. Also enhanced
      the Error window handling a bit.
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed enforcer hit that occured on clicking
      the support URL within the About window while YAM
      was starting up. (bug #576191)

2002-07-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #557524 where the doubleclick action
      on a mailto: link didn`t work anymore.
    * YAM_WR.c, YAM_CL.c: even if the Attachment NList is
      inherented from List.mui, it seems much clearer to use
      NList tags for all operations on this list. So now
      the attachment list will use NList tags when ever
      possible.
    * YAM_WR.c: fixed bug #555122 where we forgot to delete
      temporary files if an attachment that has been added to
      the attachment list of the write window was deleted
      immediatly.
    * YAM_UT.c: made our own MUI_Request() replacement even more
      compatible with some information provided by Allan.
      Now the requester should also be useable with F-keys like
      the native one and will listen to Window Closerequests also.
    * YAM_WR.c: changed the menu shortcuts for the TextEditor
      to be show up as normal shortcuts and not as CommandStrings
      as I can`t see really a good reason not to do so.
    * YAM_WR.c: fixed a tiny, but extremly nasty bug within the
      MenuStripObject for the Writewindow, that crashed a gcc
      compiled version of YAM as soon as one tried to Dispose the
      Write Window. Somehow this bug didn`t show up with SAS/C.

2002-07-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_UT.c: our own MUI_Request() reimplementation didn`t
      support a immediate exit via the "ESC" key. Now this
      should be possible like with the original MUI_Request().
    * YAM_MAf.c: did some small performance tuning to the
      MA_ExamineMail() function where we didn`t use "else if"
      constructs somehow.
      Also added a mem clearing memset() to the SaveIndex()
      function to make sure that also the reserved array of the
      index structured is somehow equal each time a index is
      regenerated.
    * YAM_TR.c: fixed small flaw in the newly introduced TCP/IP
      routines where we threw an error on the optional UIDL command
      which is not supported by all types of POP3 servers.
      There is still the flaw in YAM that if a POP3 server doesn`t
      support either TOP or UIDL command, the "Avoid Duplicates"
      option cannot somehow work and therefore we should inform the
      user about it, but as this "Avoid Duplicates" option is a
      general one for all POP3 servers in a list, we don`t bother now
      and just skip over that tiny thing, as it wouldn`t really hurt
      and otherwise it would take the user the possibility to have
      POP3 servers in his list that doesn`t support that UIDL features
      at all. We therefore should address this functionality to
      be changed within the next release and put it configurable
      for every POP3 server within the config.

2002-07-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed many major flaws within the whole TCP/IP
      routines according to some ideas from Jrg:
      1) YAM didn`t make sure that it sent/received whole command
         lines and missused some RecvDat() calls which could have
         caused some weird behaviour if receiving/sending packets
         were fragmented too much. i.e. we try to use the new
         ReadLine() function werever possible now.
      2) Reimplemented the Read/Write TCP functions to use general
         read and write buffers. Now YAM will use buffers for mail
         transfers as much as possible which could possibly speed
         mail transfers up to 100%.
      3) Improved the abort handling of the SMTP routines. Now it`s
         not possible anymore to send distorted messages by aborting
         a actual SMTP transfer.
      4) restructured the whole SMTP/POP3 command routines to use
         general identifiers for all known SMTP/POP3 commands, which
         simplified many functions and makes it easier to identify
         problems or extend the functionality in future versions.
      5) tried to improve the overall function API for all important
         TCP functions, so that they are more descriptive and open
         for future enhancements.
    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_utilities.h: replaced FreeStrBuf() function
      by a simple function macro for speed reasons.

2002-06-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed some more bugs within the transfer preselection
      routines. Mainly we forgot to filter already downloaded mail,
      even if the user aborted the transfer, this would leave
      unfiltered mail in the incoming folder.
      Secondly, the PAUSE and RESUME buttons within the preselection
      window somehow didn`t work correctly because we forgot to
      remember the last mail that was displayed within the transfer
      window. Now the whole preselection stuff should work as
      expected and a bit safer.
    * YAM.c, YAM_UT.c: fixed the recalculation routines of the
      folder listtree where it didn`t take respect of grandparent
      folder groups. If a mail within a folder had the status of
      Unread and this folder was itself also located within a full
      folder group hierarchy, all the grandparent foldergroups didn`t
      refreshed their statuses.

2002-06-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed some design bugs within the TCP/IP stuff.
      We didn`t issue a QUIT command to either the POP3 or SMTP
      server on a abort. Also fixed some enforcer hits that occured
      on aborting of transfers. This whole abort functionality
      should perform a bit better now, even if it`s implementation
      is very bad and has to be rewritten within the next release.
    * YAM.c: fixed a big flaw in the mail transfer routines
      where YAM didn`t take respect of a preselection window if
      a automatic mailcheck was selected within the Start/Finish
      section of the Config. This should fix the bugreport #555673
    * YAM.c, YAM_rexx_rxif.c: the WRITE#? and READ#? rexx commands
      were often missunderstood to work on the actual windows that
      are opened by the gui. But for these commands to work properly
      it is necessary to issue a MAILWRITE or MAILREAD command first
      to set a window active within the own arexx scope. The only
      problem that arised from the actual implementation was, that
      this scope variables were set by default to 0 and therefore
      the first opened window was the actual window this commands
      were performed on. Now YAM will set this active variables by
      default to -1 so that a user HAVE TO issue a MAILREAD/WRITE
      command before using any of the WRITE#?/READ#? commands.
      This should explain and make the reported "bugs" #555118 and
      #555120 obsolete.

2002-06-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed another flaw in the POP3 implementation of YAM
      where YAM didn`t check the statuscode of the welcome message of
      the POP3 server it was connecting to. Now YAM should pop up
      a proper error message with terminating the connection
      accordingly.
    * YAM_TR.c: fixed a small TCP/IP flaw within the APOP functions
      where YAM ignored the APOP identified supplied within the
      welcomemessage of the pop server. Now YAM should throw a
      proper error message with exiting the POP routines immediatly.
    * YAM_TR.c, YAM.cd: fixed some flaws in the ESMTP handling where
      we issued a STARTTLS command without checking previously if the
      mailer supports it or not. Also enhanced the whole ESMTP handling
      a bit, so that we can use SMTP Server extension in future easier.
      Also added some more detailed error messages to inform the user
      that a Server doesn`t support a particular selected extension.

2002-06-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM.c, YAM_TR.c: fixed missbehaviours with MUIA_Window_Activate
      where we sometimes activated the Main/Transferwindow were it
      shouldn`t be. Also fixed a bug where a MUIA_Window_Open with TRUE
      caused the window to activate if the window was already open.
      Now YAM shouldn`t interrupt the user if it`s really not
      necessary.

2002-06-22  Jacob Laursen <jlaur@mail1.stofanet.dk>

    * Improved the MCC check - now automatically attempts flushing,
      shows the version number of any existing MCC and allows for
      retrying.

2002-06-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * classes/Addrmatchlist.c: fixed bug #571831 where it could
      have happened that entries with the same Realname in the
      address matchlist caused a conflict and made it impossible
      to select the second entry.

2002-06-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * smakefile: changed SAS/C makefile to start the autogenerating
      tools automatically if something has changed. Also added
      directory variables to easily change them on compiletime.
    * YAM.c, YAM_CO.c, YAM_COg.c, YAM_COs.c, YAM_MA.c, YAM_TR.c:
      fixed a bug in the TLS/SSL recognition routines where it could
      have happen that a user selected SSL for a connection but the
      next time the amissl library is perhaps not available. In that
      situation YAM still tried to initiate a SSL connection and
      suddenly hang. Now YAM will throw a error message telling the
      user that he has selected SSL but SSL is not available right now.
      Also changed the configuration accordingly that the user can
      still disable the SSL support for those connection, but can`t
      enable it again as long as SSL is not available.
    * YAM.c: fixed bug where it could have happened that on a
      restart the AppIcon wasn`t displayed anymore.
    * YAM.c: fixed bug #560664 where YAM didn`t add the Okay
      button to the About window at initiating a restart.
    * YAM.c: fixed bug #555675 where YAM "lost" the folder group
      status on a restart of YAM.

2002-06-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Makefile.MorphOS: added stub link library calls so that YAM will
      get the correct stub functions for some STDARG functions.
      This should fix some strange hang ups when using YAM with MOS.
    * extrasrc/dice.c: removed the NO_PPCINLINE_STDARG check, because we
      cannot use the STDARG functions in there for PPC. We have to use
      stub functions instead provided by stubs libraries.
    * YAM_COg.c: added some debug information to debug the XPK a bit.
    * YAM_hook.h: added some documentation/example about the hook macros.

2002-06-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_hook.h: fixed a nasty bug within the HOOK macros for MorphOS
      that caused the whole hook stuff to freak out. :)
      Now Hooks should work as expected.

2002-06-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * reworked the handling of varargs functions within YAM to make
      it compatible/compileable with MorphOS.
      This should fix some crashes caused by misshandles vararg
      functions under MorphOS.

2002-06-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_MAf.c: fixed corrupt .index file WARNING for MorphOS.
      We simply forgot to align the .index structures for PPC. Also
      added some general ALIGN and PACKED defines to the
      SDI_compiler.h for easier use.
      NOTE: We have to be careful in future with intercommunication
      structures between 68k and PPC, so all structures that used
      directly on both plaforms (like for this .index files) have to
      be aligned for the PPC, so that this files will be compatible to
      eachother.

2002-06-10  David Rey <david@saug.org>

    * YAM_TR.c: Changed the event code issued with MSG_LOG_SendingVerbose
      to be 42.  41 was already in use by MSG_LOG_ConnectSMTP, and on the
      other hand 42 is also consistent with 32 as used by
      MSG_LOG_RetrievingVerbose
    * YAM.c: Likewise, MSG_LOG_LoggedInVerbose will use code 2 from now
      on instead of 1, which is reserved for MSG_LOG_LoggedIn

2002-06-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * all_morphos.c: removed file, because the whole libnix stuff
      of morphos is now somehow more compatible and so we can use
      the more general all_gcc.c for morphos support also
    * did some efforts on getting YAM compiled for MorphOS again.
      Updated several includes and included ppcinline includes
      to the CVS tree.
      Even if I couldn`t tested it yet, it`s compiling and linking
      correctly. So this needs some more tests until we can release
      a new MorphOS version.

2002-06-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #563641 where the ADDRDELETE function
      still didn`t work without providing an Alias. Now it should
      perform like stated in the documentation of the Arexx command.
    * YAM.h, YAM_MA.c, YAM_WR.c, YAM_write.h, YAM_rexx_rxif.*:
      change the signature of the corresponding AddSignature function
      to receive just the number of the window to add the signature to.
      That way we can easily set the Radiobutton accordingly.
    * YAM_WR.c: fixed a bug where YAM didn`t enable the correct
      Radiobutton for Signatures if the mailinglist signature
      feature was used.
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug #557522 where on a reply with a selected
      mailing list folder YAM wasn`t inserting the correct
      signature at all. Now it should insert the correct one
      depending on the mailing list variables of the folder.
    * YAM_FO.c: fixed a small, but nasty bug within the Folderimage
      allocation routines that stopped YAM somehow to show up the
      GUI if the user had just enabled one column of the Folder
      NListtree.

2002-06-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_MA.c: to be on the safe side with that ReturnID issues,
      I increased the minimum ReturnID for the Menuitems to 100,
      taking care of dynamic elements like the POP3 list.
    * YAM_utilities.h: as it seems it wasn`t that wise to
      call MUIM_Application_Input with a 0 as the signal address,
      because it still prevented it from collecting returnIDs which
      resulting in a non-working requester within the online-version
      checking.
    * #?.c: removed a whole bunch of gcc warnings. Mainly some
      suggested paratheses and wrong format descriptions.
      Nothing really serious and cross-checked with SAS/C.
    * Makefile: Changed the Makefile to be more compatible to the
      SAS/C smakefile. Now the invocation should be somehow the
      same, especially for creating non-debug versions.

2002-06-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Makefile, inline/#?: Did some efforts to get YAM compiled
      with gcc again, as we will need that in future for sure.
    * YAM_AB.c, YAM_RE.c: also added the capslock (fix) to other
      places like the addressbook and read window to allow the user
      to still use his keys with a turned on capslock.

2002-05-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM.c: fixed bug #556531. YAM will now also execute the
      Start&Stop Macros, as defined within the configuration, at
      initiating of a "Restart".

2002-05-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_MA.c: YAM treats (SHIFT)+DEL keypresses with a turned on
      CapsLock like without Capslock now. This should improve the
      usability a bit, because it can happen quite often that a user
      enables the caps lock errounously while typing around.

2002-05-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM.c, YAM.cd: added a more descriptive error message about
      the minimum requirement versions of MCCs and reworked the Abort()
      routines a bit
    * YAM.c: raised minimum requirement version for NList.mcc to
      v20.104 and NListtree v18.12 as this versions fixes some bugs
      that would otherwise make YAM unstable.
    * YAM_UT.c: reimplemented the original MUI_Request() function
      in a more secure, reliable way. This fixes some LONG READ
      enforcer hits as it seems that the original MUI_Request()
      is quite broken and shouldn`t be used at all.

2002-05-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #555128 where YAM didn`t return
      the default screenname "Workbench" on issueing a INFO screen
      rexx command, if it was iconified.
    * YAM_CO.c: fixed bug #556527 where the signature cyclegadget
      didn`t work anymore because of a incorrect return.

2002-05-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_AB.c: added a more sophisticated error handling to the
      LoadTree() function to return a proper error message even
      if the file exists but isn`t accessible at all.
    * YAM_FO.c: the bug #555117 wasn`t completly fixed because
      FO_GetFolderRexx() still counted groups as folders.

2002-05-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #555126 where the USERINFO arexx
      command also counted folder groups as real folders.
    * YAM_FO.c, YAM.cd: fixed bug #555123 by adding new localization
      strings for the Edit Folder group String requester.
    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #555117 where using the NEWMAILFILE
      arexx command worked on groups, which was obviously wrong.
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug #555116 where calling the RescanIndexHook
      on a folder which isn`t really a real one (FT_GROUP) caused
      the creation of a bogus .index file at PROGDIR:
    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #555115 where the MAILREAD
      rexx command didn`t activate a readwindow as stated
      in the documentation.
    * YAM_AB.c: fixed bug/flaw #555113 by adding additional
      checkings and a requester to inform the user that YAM
      will process a non YAM addressbook file as a newline
      separated file of email addresses.
    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_utilities.h: added a wrapper function to
      implement a MUI_Request() in a secure way. Also added a
      wrapper #define for MUI_Request() to automatically use
      the new YAMMUIRequest() function.
    * YAM_FO.c, YAM_US.c, YAM_UT.c, YAM_utilities.h:
      introduced some special macros COLLECT_RETURNIDS and
      REISSUE_RETURNIDS to handle some problems with overlapping
      ReturnID values at the usage time of MUIM_Notifys with
      MenuActions.

2002-05-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_AB.c: fixed bug #555112 where we cleared the Listtree before
      we checked if the file can be opened and therefore could have
      lost the whole addressbook if it wasn`t loadable at all.
    * accordingly to recent discussions in the dev-ML I added some
      general flag handling macros to YAM_utilities.h and spread
      them all over the sources. With this macros flag handling
      should be simplified a bit and hopefully they will also reduce
      the risk of handling flags incorrect.
      In addition to that general flag macros every flag itself has
      now some kinda "check-macro" where the current state can be
      checked by accessing it`s is/has macro which always returns
      TRUE or FALSE accordingly to the actual state.

2002-05-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added #define vars for the rule actions in YAM_main.h and
      spread them all over the sources to deal with symbolic names
      instead.
    * YAM_CO.c: changed the AddRule button behaviour a bit, so
      that it will now automatically activate the name stringgadget
      and autoselect any string in there. This should be a bit more
      handy for the user.
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug where a Remote-Filter executed actions
      it was not supposed to do and it was also possible to fire
      a remote filter were it shouldn`t have been possible at all.
      i.e. on the Filter button in the main window aso.

2002-05-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed bug where we didn`t checked the result code
      of a TR_SendCMTPCmd() call and therefore placed the mail in
      the wrong folder on an error.
    * added a proper status message to the connecting process of
      the SMTP send commands. Now YAM will show a message that
      it is trying to connect to the SMTP server. Formerly
      there were no status message at all informing the user
      about what is next.

2002-05-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * change the title generation of the MailContextMenu to show
      a subset of the Sender/Recipient instead of the Mailfile
      number.

2002-05-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added a Busy() call to the POP transfer functions so that
      the user still has a indicator what`s going on if he has
      enabled time depending mail checking.
    * fixed another bug in the ADDRRESOLVE rexx command where it
      was also checking the emailcache what is not supposed to
      happen with the command.
    * fixed bug #552414 where the creations of a Recipientstring
      object in the ADDRRESOLVE rexx command caused some enforcer
      hits later because we were refering to the renderinfo of that
      object where obviously is not renderinfo at all.
    * fixed bug #552395 where we forgot to set a pointer to a
      empty string by default to prevent a NULL pointer hit.
    * got rid of the SAS/C portability warnings #120 by modifying
      the code a bit. Now #120 warnings are turned on in the
      smakefile also.

2002-05-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug #551543 where we didn`t check for a NULL pointer in
      YAM_AB.c - AB_GotoEntry().

2002-05-01  David Rey <david@saug.org>

    * YAM_WR.c: updated the URLs given by the MIME warning in
      WR_ComposeReport.

2002-05-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * changed internal busy gauge handling a bit. Now there is the
      possibility to have multiple BusyLevels (maximum defined by
      BUSYLEVEL). This makes it possible to show a information at the
      Infobar and by ending it with BusyEnd, it will print the previous
      message that occured.
      This also fixes some bugs were we wanted to show the user some
      information but it was not possible because a previous Busy state
      wasn`t closed by BusyEnd.
    * fixed a small flaw in the PGP recognition stuff. Now YAM will
      explicitly flag a message as crypted/signed if it couldn`t be
      found out initially by scanning the header while downloading
      the message. Now YAM will flag this message as crypted/signed
      along with flagging the folder it resists in as modified.

2002-04-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed (worked-around) the bug #534430. I call this "worked-around"
      because it seems that if the autocorrect feature of TextEditor.mcc
      is turned on and we close the amissl.library within YAM somehow,
      something gets really wrong within YAM which results in strange
      crashes/lock ups as soon as the autocorrect feature gets initiate
      from within the TextEditor.mcc. I really couldn`t see any dependency
      between closing amissl.library and this lock ups within texteditor.mcc,
      but simply keeping the amissl.library open for the lifetime of YAM
      solved the problem somehow.
    * added a error message to the import mail function to tell the user
      that a selected file doesn`t contain any mails.
    * fixed bug in GetMailFile() utility functions where a -1 assignment
      to a folder wasn`t checked. This fixes a bug in the import mail
      handling as well as in other places.

2002-04-29  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * reverted the fix #508202 because as it pointed out this wasn`t
      really a bug at all.
    * changed some of those small utility functions to act as macros.
    * fixed a nasty bug in the multipart handling code where we forgot to
      close the output file on a error condition. That resulted in a
      crash if we tried to open that mail several times.

2002-04-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed some possible errors with not checking the result of Examine()
      all over at different places. Now this functions should really perform
      a bit more secure on this.

2002-04-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug in the mail listview display hook were it was possible that
      the status flag wasn`t displayed/screwed because of a too long Address
      column.

2002-04-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed serious bug in hmac_md5() function were we replaced bcopy() with
      memcpy() and overwritten the key string, because a bcopy() is per
      define a memmove(). Now the CRAM-MD5 authentification with ESMTP
      servers should work again.

2002-04-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed a TCP/IP issue flaw within the TR_Connect() function were it could
      have happened that if a particular host has 2 different IPs in the
      DNS and the first was down, YAM didn`t try to connect to the other one
      instead and just reported a error.

2002-04-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed behaviour of status flag ordering again a bit. Now it should
      really perform like stated within the documentation
    * fixed another mailfile-doesn`t-exists bugs concerning mail copying
      and transfering to another folder. Now YAM should throw proper
      error messages instead.
    * fixed more possibly bug issues on the mailfile-doesn`t-exist fact
      because the result code from MA_ExamineMail() wasn`t checked
      everywhere probably.
    * fixed bug #461926 by throwing an error requester now, informing the
      user that YAM tried to open a mail file that doesn`t exists anymore
      but is still listed in the folder.

2002-04-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug #480905/505857 by changing the temporary file handling like
      described below and also by just opening a eventually unwriteable file
      with just read because it is locked by another application (viewer)
    * changed behaviour of the temporary file handling a bit to make it more
      secure. Now YAM not only identifies tempfiles by the window and part
      number, it also takes the serialzed ID of the mail itself, so this
      tempfiles should be really unique while mail reading which will
      fix many issues/bugs that are related to that old restriction/flaw.

2002-04-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug #528105 that was caused because of the usage of one shared
      displayhook for the maillistview and the findmaillistview in the find
      window. Now we just set MUIA_NList_DisplayRecall to inform both listview
      of this situation.
    * fixed a small flaw in the Mail Listview display hook were YAM could have
      been displaying empty From: strings when a user/group doesn`t have a name
      within the addressbook. Now it just displays the email instead.
    * changed behaviour of Folder Listtree according to doubleclick events a
      bit. If the user now double clicks on a folder group it will just fold
      or unfold the tree and not popup the change requester for it. This
      feels a little bit better because in the past it could happen that
      on a doubleclick for fold/unfold the requester poped up aswell which
      was quite annoying.

2002-04-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed some problems with setting a folder active without opening the
      parent node in the hierarchical system. This kills bug #528080
    * fixed behaviour of LISTSELECT arexx command to really select/deselect all
      messages as described in the documentation. Fixes bug #508202
    * fixed some possible bugs in the arexx interface were it could happen that
      it did some harmful stuff with invalid ActiveWriteWindow values. Now these
      situations just returns an RETURN_ERROR instead.
    * the MAILWRITE command will now return a RETURN_WARN if the user tried to
      send WINDOW value other than 0 or 1.
    * changed behaviour of Arexx commands that will set a write window active.
      If now the command is executed without QUIET, the window will really go
      active. This should fix some confusion about this behaviour as well.
      This should kill one bug of ticket #466021
    * fixed bug #506533 where YAM didn`t jump to a new message when a ghosted
      folder was selected before.
    * fixed another enforcer hit that occured on filtering mails by msgbody or
      header.

2002-04-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed occuring enforcer hits in the filter routing where YAM caused some
      hits when you were filtering by message body. bug #528631
    * fixed the Status flag sorting routine accordingly to bug #474525
    * increased the max. string size for email adresses to 150 and for NAMES to 30
      That should fix bug #460430 and #511259.
    * fixed bug #456134 accordingly that it will only display the senderinfo if
      there is only one person with that realname in the Addressbook.
    * changed email string gadgets in Filter settings to use the ResolveString
      string gadget.
    * fixed bug in AttachRequest() function where it could happen that if the
      user did 2 same attachment requests it returned a partlist that the user
      hasn`t even selected. fixes bug #433800

2002-04-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * did some minor cosmetic change to the send window accordingly
      to bug #433765

2002-03-02  David Rey <david@saug.org>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed the duplicated "shift right" menu shorcut
      (bug #440010)

2002-02-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_AB.c, YAM_CL.c, YAM_CO.c, YAM_COg.c, YAM_COs.c, YAM_EA.c, YAM_FI.c,
      YAM_FO.c, YAM_MA.c, YAM_MAf.c, YAM_RE.c, YAM_TR.c, YAM_UT.c, YAM_WR.c:
      converted TABs to spaces
    * includes/inline/muimaster.h: switched to macro based inlines
    * YAM_TR.c: removed AmiSSLBase definition
    * YAM_global.c: added here

2002-02-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed smakefile accordingly to new genclasses changes.
      Now YAM should be compileable with SAS/C again.

2002-02-21  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_FI.c/FI_SearchPatternInBody: fix typo
    * YAM_MI.c/outdec: fix GCC warnings

2002-02-21  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * extrasrc/genclasses: updated for new headername convention
    * classes/Addrmatchlist.c,classes/InfoBar.c,classes/Recipientstring.c,
      classes/Searchwindow.c,classes/YAM.c: adapt includes for new naming
      convention

2002-02-20  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * libraries/pm.h: fixed GCC warnings about anonymous unions
    * proto/amissl.h: added support for different compilers
    * inline/amissl.h: added
    * extrasrc/dice.c: added AMISSL stub functions

2002-02-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added new JumpToIncoming hidden option and set it by default
      to FALSE. If enabled YAM will jump to new incoming messages
      after retrival.

2002-01-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * the listview in the find window will be sorted by date by
      default now. This makes more sense then sorting by filename
      like it did before.
    * updated the X-Mailer header to reflect 2002.

2002-01-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug in the listview display of the glossary. Now YAM
      should again display every glossary item correct.

2002-01-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug where YAM lost the LastActive variable which normally
      saves the last active entry in a mail folder and jumps to this
      position if the folder is activated again.
    * YAM now also jumps to a new received message after getting
      all mail from the POP servers with respect to the JumpToNewMsg
      option.
    * changed copyright note to reflect the new year 2002.

2001-12-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * removed support@yam.ch email from About window on request
      from Marcel Beck.
    * reworked the YAM.cd a bit.

2001-12-16  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * YAM_EA.c: Added missing MUIA_ControlChar to security cycle

2001-12-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * the SWSSearch() function requires more stack than I thought and
      so I increased it to obtain 65535 bytes to be on the safe side.
      This fixes the enforcer hit that occured on the use of the new
      autoguess feature for MLs.

2001-12-11  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed crash when the edit window was opened from
      a read window and the read window was closed before clicking
      "Send Later", "Send Now" or "Hold" in the write window.
      Fixes Bug #481316

2001-12-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * we use a Recipientstring for the return address specification
      in the configuration of AB Lists now.

2001-12-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug in email cache that caused that new entries weren`t
      added to the cache if it was already filled up completly.
    * the email cache check routines for the addressbook now only
      check for a existing AB entry with the email address because we
      don`t want to have duplicate entries in the AB and EmailCache.

2001-12-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added support for emailcache resolving in recipientstrings.
      Now YAM should also fully resolve a email adress out of the
      email cache if the user press return.

2001-12-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * the incoming folder appicon stats is now enabled by default if not
      explicitly disabled in the folder config. (Bug #484553)
    * fixed a not localized string in the MIME import functions
      (Bug #441917)
    * changed drag&drop routines of folder NListtree accordingly that
      if the user tries to drop a mail to a folder it should only appear
      if he has the mouse over the folder and not above or below it.
      Also changed the DragReport routines that if the user drops a
      folder onto another folder a sign should not appear and only drops
      below or above should be allowed.
      Concerning the MAIL->FOLDER drop routines there seems to be still a
      flaw in NListtree because it`s somehow still possible to drag a mail
      in between of two folder but it will then be moved to one of those.

2001-12-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * removed the tiny font from the Autodetect button in the folder
      configuration following the MUI Styleguide.
    * reapplied the tiny font in the info bar.

2001-11-25  AmiS <amis@amiga.org.ru>

    * Added "Codepage Autodetect/Translation" option.
      If this option is enabled, YAM will statistically analyse
      message text, from/to/subject fields and MIME text/* attachments
      (independently) and automatically translate them to system codepage.
      Mainly for cyrillic users.  See guide for detailed description.

2001-11-22  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Commas inside quotes are now accepted as valid characters in
      recipient strings.

2001-11-20  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * (YAM.c/InitLib): changed return type to APTR for better NDK
      compatibility and removed cast of InitLib() calls
    * YAM_global.c: unified yamversion#? strings

2001-11-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * removed a unneeded error message in the SMTP send routines
      as the TR_SendSMTPCmd() always throws out errors on failure.

2001-11-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added SMTP SSL/TLS support through AmiSSL accordingly to
      (RFC 2487)
    * fixed bug in the SMTP routines where it happened that
      if a SMTP AUTH request wasn`t succesfull we forgot to
      disconnect from the server.
    * fixed a bug in the SMTP AUTH routines where the server response
      wasn`t displayed to the user on a authentication failure.
    * made some cosmetic code changes to the SMTP AUTH part.
    * added possibility to explicitly specify the POP3 and SMTP Port
      in a string gadget in the configuration.
    * added POP3 SSL/TLS support for stunnel servers (port 995) and
      also POP3-server that supports the STLS command set like
      suggested in (RFC 2595)
    * implemented optional TLS/SSL support by using AmiSSL library
      from Andrija Antonijevic, which is a public AmigaOS port
      of OpenSSL (RFC 2246)

2001-11-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed a security flaw in YAM where it was possible that a user
      received a mail with special escape sequences in the Mail header
      that were interpreted by MUI. And with additional knowledge
      about PIPE mechanisms it was possible to execute real commands
      that could harm the system!
      YAM now strips out those escape sequences in the header of a
      mail as soon as it receives them.

2001-10-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug where a empty ", ," string in a recipient gadget were
      resolved as the whole AB.
    * on resolve, if a realname doesn`t exists in the AB, the recipient
      resolve feature only completes the address with the email.
    * if more than one entry for a recipientstring is found in the
      addressbook the Resolve routines doesn`t just take the first
      one for resolving, they now stop resolving it.
    * fixed a little flaw in the recipientstring class where it
      wasn`t possible to select the correct recipient if more
      than one entry with the same realname was found in the
      addressbook.
    * Parts in a multipart mail will now be displayed colored to
      indicate that they are clickable.

2001-10-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM now also brings all windows to the front if the AppIcon
      is doubleclicked while the main window is open.
    * implemented match & save functions for new emailcache
      feature. Now YAM should save/move entries in the emailcache
      list to the corresponding file. This finally finishes the
      emailcache feature.

2001-10-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added functions/methods to use the new emailcache on a
      recipientstring. Moved match function from the addrmatchlist
      to the YAM main subclass like proposed in the mailinglist.
    * added config entry and GUI elements for upcoming emailcache
      feature. Also reconfigured some GUI elements to use a
      NumericbuttonObject.

2001-10-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added feature to try to automatically detect the mailinglist
      pattern and To: field by integrating the Smith&Waterman
      algorithm for a string similarity search.
      YAM will try to detect the pattern from the first 5 messages
      in a folder and only if the pattern is != #? it will be
      placed into the pattern string gadget.
      This should make it easier to enter the correct mailinglist
      pattern.
    * by default we disable the ML support for the standard folders
      like INCOMING/OUTGOING/SENT/DELETED.
    * the mailinglist support of every folder can now be explicitly
      enabled/disabled

2001-10-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * the folder configuration window now also uses YAM`s standard
      Addressfield string for the ML support.

2001-10-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * changed InfoBar label refresh not to refresh the folder image
      also, because this causes some unnecessary flickering while
      opening a read mail window.
    * added user ability to define the InfoBar label with own text
      and inputs from a folder. This finishes the missing features
      of the new InfoBar.

2001-10-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed enforcer hit that happened on a manual filter operation.
    * added ability to configurate the position of the new Infobar
      along with the ability to disable it completly.
    * changed catalog description for the new introduced size formats
      in YAM, because they were a bit strange :)

2001-10-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed another bug that caused the insert of a wrong signature
      if a user replied to a message that resisted in the incoming
      folder.
    * fixed a tiny bug in the StripSignature routines were it could
      have happened that a signature doesn`t get stripped.

2001-10-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed another bug in the ML support were it happened that on a
      reply of a mail without a ReplyTo: field the mail were sent
      to the mailinglist and the sender.

2001-10-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug #468896 where the old Folder/Order/Reset option caused
      a serious crash of YAM.
    * added reload tree option to the folder context menu
    * switched off automatic sorting of the folder listtree because it`s
      not supported yet.
    * Added/Created new InfoBar class, removed the bottom gauge bar and
      made this InfoBar a default setting.
      This new InfoBar combines the old first version of the InfoBar
      together with the bottom GaugeBar and Busy texts/gauges are only
      displayed if necessary.

      This InfoBar class is NOT finished yet and there are still some
      unimplemented features like:
      - user configurable InfoBar position (Top/Center/Bottom)
      - user configurable Folder text (number of new mails etc.)

      The new style of this InfoBar is not finished yet and any suggestion
      is welcome.

2001-09-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed another bug in the folder listtree were on a drag&drop mail
      move operation the incorrect folder was refreshed if a folder
      group was fold.
    * fixed bug in folder listtree were it wasn`t possible to drag any
      mail to another folder if one of the folder groups were fold.

2001-09-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug #432328 where the wrong image was displayed if a folder
      was a password protected one.
    * fixed bug #450062 where the index of some folders wasn`t displayed
      because only visible entries of the Listtree were selected to be
      displayed.

2001-09-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug #432331 where it happened that, if no action was performed
      at the start of YAM that caused the AppIcon to refresh, no AppIcon
      was displayed at all.
    * fixed bug #459478 where MyStrCpy() was used with a string pointer
      while MyStrCpy() doesn`t accept string pointer, which will result in
      a broken string copy.

2001-09-12  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * YAM_RE.c: Now accepts "(" and ")" in URLs also
      (according to RFC 1738, ";" are also allowed in some cases
       but not yet added)
      Fixes Bug #460488

2001-09-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * commented MUIA_Application_Sleep calls in Busy() function. This is the
      cause for bug #458521. This busybar stuff anyway will be reworked
      completly if the new infobar is finished which will replace this
      bottom busybar.
    * modified makefile to reflect new genclasses tool
      Now you can directly compile the genclasses tool by specifing
      the smakefile target "GenClasses".
      You can also execute the genclasses tool to auto-generate
      all necessary sourcesfiles with the target "ClassInfo".
    * modified class sources to be compatible with the new genclasses
      tool from Andrew.

2001-09-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added error message to move mail filter operation if it tries
      to move a mail to a folder that couldn`t be found by name.
      This can happen if a filter rule exists and the user renames
      a folder. Now a error message pops up and tells the user that
      this operation failed !
    * added missing localization to the newfoldergroup requester.
    * fixed bug #433745 where YAM was not displaying the check.info
      icon anymore.
    * fixed bug #433751 that caused flickering of the AppIcon after
      recalculating the statistics.
    * added standard source headers to new classfiles
    * set emailcache filename lowercase with a uppercase assign.

2001-08-22  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * When using D(DBF_ERROR, ()) then a DisplayBeep() is issued.
    * The FindUserData-hook used to resolve email aliases is now restricted to
      only find matches of type AET_USER or AET_LIST.

2001-08-05  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Added loading of email cache in OM_NEW of new application subclass.
    * Added Debug.c and Debug.h to the repository. The system is used like
      this (notice no \n and no ;):
             D(DBF_ALWAYS, ("this value is %ld", val))
      When DEBUG isn't defined this turns into ';', so you can write:
             for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
                D(DBF_ERROR, ("invalid item: %ld", a[i]))
      I.e. without using braces.
      DBF_ALWAYS is used for stuff that must always be shown. DBF_ERROR when
      something fails. DBF_VERBOSE is for generally interesting messages which
      doesn't really fit a category. The rest of the flags has to be added
      when required. They should be categorized, i.e. no flag for 'my fancy
      feature', but instead a flag for i/o, network stuff etc.
      You enable debug output with "SetEnv YAMDebug flags". Flags is a
      comma, space or semi-colon separated list of stuff you want enabled.
      E.g. "io, verbose, error". You can also enter "all" to get everything
      enabled.
      Currently 'always' and 'error' are enabled by default (and can't be
      disabled).
    * Some styleguide changes.
    * Changed version string to say 'dev' instead of 'devel'.
    * Added an application subclass which is now used.

2001-08-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * ContextMenus now also open in areas where no mail/folder is, so that this
      popupmenus can be used to generate at least a new folder/group or mail.
    * If a context menu is opened on a already active entry the maillist will
      not be refreshed anymore. This should reduce flickering at least on
      already active entries.

2001-08-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Now respects the "Iconified on startup" MUI setting. If the HIDE
      tooltype is present, it'll override it.

2001-08-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * the delete folder menu item & context menu entry does not allow to remove
      the incoming/deleted/sent/outgoing folder anymore. This was the standard
      behaviour before the hierarchical folder system was added and was broken.
      This fixes bug #445602 also.
    * if a folder group is going to be deleted YAM will pop up a requester now
      asking the user to confirm if it is not empty. If this folder group
      contains any subfolders or another group, then this subentries will be
      moved to the parent folder of the group first.
    * reverted changes to the resolve method of the recipientstring to reduce
      complexity of the code. (who requested this... guess?)
    * turned the ChangeLog upsidedown. Now the newest entry should always be
      attached to the top because this is more natural.

2001-08-05  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Fixed enforcer hit in Recipientstring class (censored).
    * ResolveOnCR defaults to FALSE similar to AdvanceOnCR.
    * Pressing 'delete' in a recipient string will now delete close the popup
      list.
    * The mails in the main listview are now shown to be from the real name
      of the sender found in your addressbook (this name should also be used
      when replying to the letter and composing the greeting phrase, but is
      currently not).
    * Removed classes/Classes.h dependency from class sources!
    * Added ClassesExtra.h file.
    * Added section about tags and compact switch/cases to the styleguide.
    * Moved the address list popup window to its own class.
    * The adddress list popup window will now adapt to the position and size
      of the parent window, when changed.
    * Escape will now close the address matchlist popup window (and
      MUIKEY_WINDOW_CLOSE is disabled for the recipient string as long as the
      window is open).

2001-08-02  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Recipientstring class no longer sets the frame, cyclechain or 'advance
      on cr' tags.
    * Ensured that all source descriptions are now prefixed with ' Module:'.
      This allows e.g. to do a Search YAM_#?.c "*N Module:" to see the
      description of each source file.

2001-08-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added a MUIA_Recipientstring_NoResolve attribute to the recipientstring
      class. If this attribute is set to TRUE the recipientstring is not going
      to perform a resolving on the entered string, what means in fact that it
      will not transform it with a realname or something else.
    * fixed some bugs recently introduced to the recipientstring class.
    * the recipient string class now only set the focus on the next object
      if the MUIA_String_AdvanceOnCR is set.
    * renamed the MUIA_Recipientstring_Resolve_NoResolve to _ResolveOnCR
      accordingly to some discussions.
    * renamed GetMUI() function to xget() because this is a more "standard"
      name for this function.
    * the ShowMatches() method of the recipient string class is now using
      SetAttrs() for setting the list position.
    * added EXPORT statement for the MUIF_ flags to the recipient string class
      to allow the autogen tool to take care about this.
    * removed obsolete DD_String class stuff including WR_ResolveName() and
      WR_ExpandAddresses()
    * modified smakefile to reflect every dependency for the classes.

2001-08-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * changed RETURN, SHIFT+RETURN behaviour as discussed in the mailing list.
      Now YAM should resolve any entered string without the realname if the user
      press SHIFT+RETURN in a recipientstring gadget.
    * changed the string gadget checks if a mail is going to be sent accordingly
      to the above behavior. Now YAM will pop up an error requester if a user
      tries to send a email and it can`t resolve any entered string or if the
      From: is missing.
    * YAM will also change the focus of the pagegroup and string gadget that
      produced the failure, so that the user can immediatly change it.
    * added From: is missing warning requester. Now YAM will warn the user that
      the From: string is empty and allow him to either use the default sender
      address from the config or reenter the string again.
    * fixed bug in recipient string where the position of the popuplist was not
      set everytime it was opened. This caused that if the window was moved in
      between of two popups, then the popuplist was displayed on a wrong position.
      Still one flaw:
      1)if the window is moved while the popuplist ist open, then the popuplist
        will not move it`s position in sync with the window.

2001-08-01  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_rexx.c (global): added REXXMSG macro to hide annoying NDK difference
      (ReplyRexxCommand, DoRXCommand): use it
    * YAM_rexx.c: small cleanups

2001-07-31  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Addressbook popup gadget is no longer in cyclechain as you can popup the
      book with the standard MUI popup key (defaults to ctrl-p) -- I really
      would prefer to turn it into a real Popstring gadget, but currently the
      hook to open the address book require both global and local info etc.
    * Each change of the recipient string will result in an attempt of
      completing the address which is in front of the cursor. Earlier e.g.
      deleting a character wouldn't.
    * The recipient class now has a tag for "allow multiple recipients". This
      is enabled for the From and Reply-To strings (which it wasn't earlier).
    * The recipient class has a method to resolve the names entered. The
      MakeRecipients() function setup a notify on MUIA_String_Acknowledge to
      call this method.
    * When resolving a list then it will recursively continue to expand
      members of this list so one can have a list of lists. Though this is
      currently limited to 5 recursions.
    * The 'resolve' gadget has been removed (since it happens on return anyway
      in the writewindow) and thus the 'focus on return' scheme has been
      removed entirely.
    * There's now a popup list when YAM attempts to complete what the user is
      typing in a recipient string. It contain 3 columns for alias, real name
      and address. The entire string of the column which match what the user
      is entering is in bold, though limited to SIZE_ADDRESS characters due
      to the static display hook buffer. The list is sorted accodring to which
      field match and secondly alphabetically.
    * Using arrow up/down when the popup list is open immidiately change the
      contents of the string gadget and pressing return will act as if the
      popup wasn't shown (i.e. it will be interpreted by the gadget, so
      MUIA_String_Acknowledge will go high).
    * As with the old class one can enter a comma while text is marked (during
      a completion) and the comma will be inserted behind the marked text
      instead of overwriting it.
    * The alias, real name and address stringgadgets of the addressbook (new
      user, new list and new group windows) no longer accept comma as a valid
      character.
    * The stringgadget for entering list members (in the list window of the
      addressbook) is now a Recipientstring. It doesn't auto-transform on
      return (since often you want the alias in the list, so that a change to
      the address of this alias will also affect the list). Also, it currently
      lack the addressbook gadget. This is only because I was lazy when I
      added it... we could just cut'n'paste the code from MakeRecipient(), but
      I want this Recipientstring to instead be a popuplist which handle the
      addressbook itself.
    * Put the Okay gadget in the (stupid) subject warning requester as default
      (didn't I already do that?).
    * Trim() now accepts a NULL pointer (returns NULL).
    * Added a STR() define to YAM_utilities.h. This transforms a define into a
      string. This is useful e.g. if you do sprintf and want to limit the
      string length to that of a define. E.g. in the AB_PrettyPrint() function
      I do the following:
         static TEXT buf[SIZE_REALNAME + SIZE_ADDRESS + 4];
         sprintf(buf, "%." STR(SIZE_REALNAME) "s <%." STR(SIZE_ADDRESS) "s>",
            e->RealName, e->Address);
    * Added DUFF define to smakefile -- I'll soon remove the define, but my
      code has made a lot of functions obsolete and I'm going to wait a little
      before I start to remove all this code (which is currently marked by an
      #ifndef DUFF).
    * One can go back in the recipientstring gadget and change previous
      entries, even with name completion (earlier that would delete the rest
      of the string). The completion will only kick in if the character under
      the cursor is '\0' or ','.

 Some bugs/flaws which remain: 

[FIXED] ADDRRESOLVE arexx command is currently broken. Reason is that I have
        retired the WR_Resolve() function which this command require. Suggested
        solution is that the command simply create a Recipientstring objectc,
        set the alias as contents in this object and calls the
        MUIM_Recipientstring_Transform method.
[FIXED] When using a list in the To gadget then the From and Reply-To fields
        won't be changed to that setup in the addressbook. Reason: this was
        really a hack before IMHO (testing various pointers to figure if and
        where to set the new strings). Also, some problems arise if letter is
        sent to multiple lists. Suggested solution would be to introduce
        two tags which tell the recipientstring object which object(s) it should
        propagate the (new) From and Reply-To addresses.
      * When typing the last character of an alias (while the popup list is
        open) then the popup list won't close. Reason being that the
        Recipientstring class doesn't notice that the string change (user
        overwrites last marked character with same character).
      * There's currently no warning requester when one of the recipient strings
        can't resolve the names (but a DisplayBeep(NULL) and a
        "DB(kprintf();)").

    * Renamed MUIM_Recipientstring_Transform method to
      MUIM_Recipientstring_Resolve for consistency with the rest of the YAM
      source.
    * Fixed ADDRRESOLVE arexx command further. Btw: this command would earlier
      (YAM 2.2) return a random string on failure.

2001-07-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug #440000. Now the NListtree default foldergroup icons will be
      displayed if one of the folder_fold/unfold images are missing.
    * fixed bug #445715. YAM should now not change the Track Message flag if
      a message is going to edit.
    * WR_WriteUserInfo() now takes respect of the alternative selected From:
      address of the folder the mail was created in.

2001-07-29  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Rewrote the eventhandler of the recipient string. The new code should be
      much simpler and thus more transparent.
      Some functionality still lack and it needs some finetuning (e.g.
      multiple recipient support)...

2001-07-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Changed code layout of the new classes files accordingly to the standard
      layout of YAM and added the fold/unfold marks.

2001-07-28  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Moved the Recipient String class to its own file
      (classes/Recipientstring.c) and added a popup window when multiple
      candidates exist for address completion. Some functionality is still
      pending (you can navigate the list with arrow up/down but return just
      does a DisplayBeep()) -- you need to define DUFF for this to work.

2001-07-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * removed possible enforcer hit in YAM_FO.c where the destructor of
      the folder listtree called FO_FreeFolder and tried to remove a Object
      with a InitChange where this Group doesn`t exists anymore.
    * change addressfield completion accordingly to some discussions on the
      mailinglist. if you now press SHIFT+RETURN after entering a string that
      matches a addressbook entry to should not complete it with the realname.
      Also if you send a mail it will not complete already valid email addresses.

2001-07-24  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Centered the checkmark (and label) in the search window.

2001-07-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * change MA_ExamineMail() to only check for uuencoded attachments if the
      header itself doesn`t tell us that this mail in a MULTIPART mail.
      This should speed up the "update index" as well as the download of mail
      a bit.
      Also removed the maximum check of the first 30 lines for a UUE check
      of a mail.
    * added missing status_flags to the Status Group of the read window. Now
      it should show all statuses accordingly to the message status

2001-07-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * removed MUIA_NList_Quiet calls in DisplayMailList YAM_UT.c because
      this will speed up the insertion of items for 3-4 seconds with ~6000
      items. (This is a strange behaviour of the NList class itself)

2001-07-18  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Fixed some wrong RexxMsg types.
    * Enhanced the output of the smake process and also did other minor
      changes to the smakefile (e.g. cleanall now use clean).
    * When DEBUG is enabled NewReadArgs.c includes YAM_debug.h.
    * mail is set to NULL to get rid of that 'uninitialized' warning.
    * Added Classes.c,h to the repository, though these files are
      auto-generated (so they'll go again when I add the auto-generate tool).
    * Re-added Searchwindow.c with uppercase 's' to the repository.
    * Enabled Searchwindow.c in smakefile, since it should compile.
    * The 'search' function of the write window now works. There's only one
      search window (in the global structure) which should probably also be
      used if anyone adds search to the readwindow.

2001-07-17  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * Makefile: renamed revision 1.12 to Makefile.MorphOS 
    * Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS: renamed revison 1.14 to Makefile
    * Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS-ixemul: deleted

2001-07-17  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: (struct Args): fixed GCC cpp problem

    * YAM.c, YAM_addressbookEntry.h, YAM_main.h, YAM_utilities.h, YAM_write.h
      includes/proto/genesis.h: fixed GCC warnings

2001-07-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * replaced "remailer@replay.com" in YAM_CO.c with a uptodate remailer,
      because replay.com no longer provides a remailer service.

2001-06-29  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_hook.h: use proper types in hook casts, change placement of SAVEDS
      in DISPATCHERPROTO to match other uses, added cast for ENTRY argument in
      AmigaOS case

    * YAM_utilities: added OUT_DOS define as replacement for incorrect NULL
      usage
    * YAM_MA.c: (MA_ExecuteRuleAction,MA_StartMacro): use OUT_DOS
    * YAM_TR.c: (TR_ApplyRemoteFilters,TR_NewMailAlert): likewise

    * YAM_rexx_rxcl.c: changed RESINDEX to utilize stddef.h/offsetof()

    * extrasrc/dice.c: added test for VBCC
    * includes/extra.h: more general access() handling

    * added all_vbcc.c, inlines/*_protos.h and VMakefile

2001-06-25  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Added MyAddHead() function to YAM_UT.c.
    * When reading folder contents messages are now added to the head of the
      list rather than the tail. This makes reading large folder index much
      faster (since AddTail is O(n)), however NList layout is still required,
      so it's still painfully slow...

2001-06-24  Dirk Stcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * YAM.c Added proper exitcode and modified Abort()
    * Added classes directory, moved Searchwindow_class to this as
      searchwindow.c, modified smakefile to support this, disabled it
      in smakefile, as it does not yet compile (remove # in CLASSES line
      to enable again)

2001-06-22  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Fixed toolbar init code (uses "tb_butt[i]." instead of const "p->").
    * Added extra toolbar button to write window (search) -- nop ATM.
    * Added new source to the repository (Searchwindow_class.c).

2001-06-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_utilities.h: added "struct NewToolbarEntry"
    * YAM_AB.c (AB_New): merged tb_butt[] and tb_help[] using that struct

    * YAM_RE.c (RE_New): likewise
    * YAM_WR.c (Wr_New): likewise

2001-06-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_read.h: (struct RE_GUIData) fixed wrong toolbar array size,
      was off by one since at least YAMos 2.2 ...
    * YAM_utilities.h: added ARRAY_SIZE define
    * YAM_AB.c (AB_New): use it
    * YAM_EA.c (EA_New): likewise
    * YAM_MA.c (MA_New): likewise
    * YAM_RE.c (RE_New): likewise
    * YAM_WR.c (Wr_New): likewise

2001-06-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_AB.c,YAM_CL.c,YAM_CO.c,YAM_COg.c,YAM_COs.c,YAM_EA.c,YAM_FI.c,
      YAM_MA.c,YAM_RE.c,YAM_TR.c,YAM_US.c,YAM_UT.c,YAM_WR.c,
      YAM_rexx_rxif.c: added missing "extra.h", fixed double inclusion
      and corrected its usage

2001-06-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * smakefile: added OPTCOMPLEXITY=5 OPTDEPTH=3 to OPTFLAGS,
      created LNKFLAGS
    * makeall.ados: removed MAP file renaming since smakefile already
      creates the "correct" one, fixed scompare statements
    * Makefile, Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS: removed "-c" from $(CDEFS)
    * YAM_RE.c: (RE_SendMDN) added const qualifier
    * YAM_COg.c: (CO_Page7) fix formatting
    * YAM_COs.c: (CO_Save) likewise
    * YAM_UT.c: (CloneWorkbenchPath) likewise
    * YAM_WR.c: (MIMewarn,PGPwarn) likewise

2001-06-20  Dirk Stcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * fixed smakefile: $< does NOT work, when there are 2 or more depencies
      in the header line! This only works, if the header files are never
      changed and this very unlikely.
    * Also adding $(CDEFS) before RESOPT was not that clever at all.
    * makeall.dos now uses the stuff Gunther introduced

2001-06-20  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * makeall.ados: replaced "move" with "rename"
    * smakefile: changed CFLAGS handling, changed LINK statement
    * Makefile, Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS: restructured
    * starter.c: cleanup

2001-06-20  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

2001-06-20  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: (Initialise) use iconfile as buffer for hideicon,
      move hidecion loading to an appropriate location
      (header) cleanup

      (WR_New, WR_NewBounce) likewise, fixed GCC warning

2001-06-19  Dirk Stcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * documented disabled warnings in smakefile, remove 2 disabled warnings
    * mada DATA=NEAR in smakefile, suggested by Gunther
    * added YAMOS-texts to other makefiles

2001-06-19  Giles Burdett <layabouts@the-giant-sofa.demon.co.uk>

    * Added #include <extra.h> to a number of files to stop "implicit declaration"
      warnings caused by usage of extra string functions
    * YAM now uses it's own icon when being hidden/iconified, instead of default
      icon provided by MUI

2001-06-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed potential enforcer hits where check for NULL of FO_GetCurrentFolder()
      was missing. Should also fix some enforcer hits on exit of YAM.

2001-06-18  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: (Terminate) always release resources in reverse allocation order
      (main) removed warning about return type and discarded STACKEXT
      (NOTE: STACKEXT doesn't do what was intended! It does *only* extend the
      stack if there is not enough space for the current frame. Thats hardly
      the case for main() ...)
    * YAM_FI.c: fix prototype for FI_IsFastSearch()
    * YAM_global.(c,h): replaced "APTR" with "void *" and removed include
    * YAM_UT.c: (DisplayAppIconStatistics) replaced AppAppIconA() with AddAppIcon()
      (DisplayStatistics) small cleanup

2001-06-18  Giles Burdett <layabouts@the-giant-sofa.demon.co.uk>

    * Added file dependencies listed in smakefile to Makefile, Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS and
      Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS-ixemul.
    * Added GNUC section to YAM_global.c to handle stack stuff - it is an empty section
      because GCC supports neither __stack nor __buffsize, but this empty define should
      really stay so that this fact is recorded instead of leading others to think that
      GCC support has not been considered.

2001-06-17  Dirk Stcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * Moved __USE_SYSBASE from YAM_UT.c to smakefile (where it really belongs to).
    * Changed YAM_global.c stack stuff. This needs to be completed.
    * Made some more stuff static.
    * Moved last old.h stuff, old.h got obsolete now. First reordering step
      finished.
    * smakefile reflects the correct dependencies now. Please addapt this for
      other makefiles as well.

2001-06-17  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed "give up after 20 lines" signature strip "feature".
      (Bug #432034)

2001-06-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * the position of a folder was calculated wrong on performed FOLDERINFO rexx
      commands. fixed!
    * if using the folder context menu now, the mail list will be refreshed if
      the user uses the context menu on a folder that is not active. This will
      fix some bugs that will result because the mail list is not in sync with
      the folder list.
    * fixed several bugs concerning syncing of the mail and folder list.
      This also hopefully fixed now really (Bug #433825)

2001-06-16  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * C_c.sd: changed GetStripStr() to work with older versions of flexcat
    * YAM_CO.c: includes "extra.h" to get prototypes for non SAS/C
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed potential enforcer hits dueto FO_GetCurrentFolder() returning NULL
      (NOTE: There are more cases which need fixing!)
    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_WR.c: fixed warnings
    * YAM_WR.c: changed to enable optimizations for SAS/C
    * YAM_global.c: added additional processor checks for GCC and VBCC
    * YAM_rexx_rxcl.c: swapped include order of YAM_#?.h to get rid of warnings
    * extrasrc/dice.c: added popupmenu functions and cleanup
    * includes/extra.h: removed isascii define
    * YAM_WR.c: added isascii define

2001-06-16 Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * No longer sets MUIA_Window_Open to TRUE for main window on uniconify.
      (this had the effect of bringing main window to front on uniconify)
    * Added #define __USE_SYSBASE to YAM_UT.c so that it compiles with SAS/C.
    * Message list no longer has MUIA_NList_DefaultObjectOnClick set to TRUE
      since this makes it non-default when clicking outside the listview.
    * Now sets MUIA_BetterString_KeyUp/DownFocus for the To and Subject
      strings in the mail write window.
    * Updated BetterString_mcc.h (latest Betterstring.mcc can be found in the
      file area of YahooGroups.Com/yamos/).
    * When pressing ',' in the recipient string and text is marked, the comma
      will be inserted at the end of the string. This is to allow easier
      name-completion with multiple recipients.
    * Now sets GUI.NL_MAILS as the default object instead of GUI.LV_MAILS.
    * No longer sets the folder list as active window object when no entries
      exist in the message list (this would e.g. happen after sending emails
      from the outbox, because the outbox goes empty before returning to the
      inbox).
    * The OK gadget in the about window now have some space on each side of
      the label, bares the label 'Okay', is the default object and rendered in
      bold (to indicate the user can use 'return' to continue).
    * The OK gadget is now added after first phase of startup (rather than
      setting MUIA_ShowMe to TRUE) -- mainly because it's now 2 rectangle
      objects and the gadget, so we'd need to set the MUIA_ShowMe value for 3
      objects (not to mention that MUIA_ShowMe is buggy). Also
      MUIA_Window_Activate is set after this initial setup phase, so selecting
      about should now bring up an *active* about window.
    * Cancel is no longer the default gadget in the 'missing subject'-warning
      (since that'd make both the return and escape key act as cancel).

2001-06-16  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Re-added uniconify behaviour when attempting to start a second instance
      of YAM (without enforcer hits).
    * Corrected 'Check version' date.

2001-06-16  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * changed the behaviour of the WarnSubject requester due to some discussions
      in the YAMos ML.

2001-06-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * reactivated information bar, but made it optional. Now a user can select
      if he wants to have the infobar or not.
    * now the ContextMenus for the folder and message list are optional. A user can
      select in the configuration if he wants to have context menus or not.
      (Please note that if a context menu is selected and the user has the mouse
      over the list, the menu shortcuts will not work anymore due to a bug of MUI)
    * made WarnSubject a public option. The user can now select in the config if he
      wants to be warned or not if he is going to send a message without a subject.
    * fixed alignment bug in struct Rule.
    * Flush indices didn`t work on grouped folders - fixed. (Bug #433506)
    * Folder groups will be displayed highlighted&bold now if any child has new or
      unread mail.
    * if popupmenu.library is not present, the contextmenus are disabled completly
      now and it is possible to use the normal menu with shortcuts. Also the config
      items for the ContextMenu are disabled.
    * fixed recently introduced enforcer hits (Bug #433797)

2001-06-15  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed information bar, since it was redundant.

    * Removed error messages when unable to load images.

    * Last year digit was missing in error window - fixed! (Bug #431947)

2001-06-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug that caused that it was not possible to remove a entry from the folder
      listtree. (BUG #431912)
    * reworked addressbook search functions (AB_SearchEntry) completly. Now a search
      in the addressbook should perform faster. This will result in a faster
      name completion in AddressFields and if a mail is going to be sent out
    * fixed some addressbook<->NListtree related bugs/issues.
    * fixed Distribution List bug (BUG #431536)

2001-06-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed alignment Problem in "struct ComprMail" which causes the corruption of
      the old .index files from older 2.x versions. Now we should be compatible again.
    * merge the differences from RELEASE 2.3 branch to actual MAIN branch

2001-06-10  Dirk Stcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * moved a lot more stuff to the corresponding header files
    * removed all includes from old.h
    * created YAM_global.h and YAM_global.o
    * made a lot of stuff static to YAM_RE.c, removed obsolete hook
    * changes smakefile to use $(CC) instead of slink

2001-06-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed folder shortcut keys "0-9" to have a fast jump to a folder.
      Folder groups are excluded here and will be overjumped. Also a folded tree will
      be unfolded if the user press a number where the tree was folded.
    * reworked and optimized some code in the addressbook code.
    * fixed addressbook entry selection bug. If a new mail was created and the user
      doubleclicked a entry in the addressbook to get the name in the addressfield
      YAM was not coping this address.
    * changed Library check routine to show the required revision also. Users where
      complaining about the NList.mcc v19.97 -> v19.98 upgrade requirement and the
      error message just showed "required v19".
    * fixed enforcer hit when creating a new folder in the listtree. -bug #431614

2001-06-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed addressbook NListtree bug where status_group image got trashed somehow.
    * now YAM doesn`t require the PROGDIR:Icons/* images anymore. This "feature" was
      added accidently and now it should only print a warning message to the
      Errorwindow of YAM.

2001-06-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * v18.7 of NListtree.mcc is now required because all earlier version seems to be too
      buggy to allow them.
    * The alternative images of the OUTGOING and DELETED folder will now be displayed if
      there is any mail in the folders. This is a more natural behaviour.
    * now the SortFlag of the NList Mail List should work again without flickering the
      Listview.
    * removed "Flush indices" entry of the FolderList ContextMenu

2001-06-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * 'Folder/Check single account' menu is no longer trashed after
      clicking 'Use' in the configuration window. (Bug #425212).

2001-06-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added next version of the folder_xxxx images to CVS
    * included the new folder_xxxx images in the code. Now also alternative images
      for INCOMING/OUTGOING and DELETED show be loaded and if there is new mail in the
      folder the image should change accordingly.
    * added a nice FolderInfoBar above the Listviews. Perhaps we have to make this
      bar optional, but I think it will fit in the layout if we are going to
      introduce TearOff.mcc in YAM.
    * changed FolderInfoBar refreshing. Now it should not flicker anymore and refreshing
      the main NList Mail List should be fast again.

2001-06-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * checked memory allocation&freeing of the folder listtree and it`s mails. Now it
      seems that all works fine.
    * reactivated the CompareHook for the folder listtree. Here we still have to do
      some modifications.

2001-06-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed recently introduced enforcerhit in the parsing of content-disposition
      parts
    * fixed LoadBCImage function where something went wrong with the stcpfn()
      function
    * added folder images from Philip A. Vedovatti to std images.

2001-06-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added support to load standard images for the standard INCOMING/OUTGOING/SENT
      and DELETED folder. The images must have the name "folder_incoming" a.s.o.
      at the PROGDIR:Icons/ directory to get loaded.
    * fixed alternative folder image function. This feature was broken and if you
      placed an image in the folder directory ".fimage" to was loaded incorrect.
      This should work now and if you have such an image file placed in the folder
      directory it will override the standard image that is loaded by YAM.
    * added a separate Error-Requester to screem out that an standard image file
      couldn`t be loaded.
    * added separate "supportfiles/Icons/std" directory at the cvs to place all the
      standard images+icons that should be included in the main YAM archive.

2001-06-01  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * created YAM_debug.h with stuff taken from old.h/YAM.h
    * YAM_FO.c, YAM_MAf.c, YAM_RE.c: use "YAM_debug.h"
    * YAM_UT.c: lame fix for a MUI header problem with GCC
    * YAM_md5.c: removed non-breaking spaces

2001-05-28  Dirk Stcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * replaced MD5 calculation by PD variant

2001-05-27  Dirk Stcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * moved a lot more stuff to the corresponding header files
    * NOTE: YAM_UT.c should be splitted!
    * Maybe the global variables from YAM.c should move into new file YAM_global.c?

2001-05-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed BUG #407550. Had to insert a InputBuffered at start to assure that G-TR
      gets cleared or otherwise it will be became NULL later which caused that
      mass of hits reported in the BugTracker.
    * a CTRL-C will now break the application and a CTRL-D will restart it immediatly.

2001-05-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added option to define the AppIcon Label that should be displayed. Now a
      User can configurate the string that should be displayed below the AppIcon
      by reconfigurating it in the configuration window (Misc)
    * YAM reads the Content-Disposition: of a multipart message now. If a name of
      a part could not be found in the Content-Type: field we get it from the
      Disposition field now. (i.e. mails with attachments from ELM behave like this)
      [ this fixes the reported bug #285 from Holger J.]
    * fixed today introduced bug. Now the AppIcon Label text gets saved & loaded
      correctly
    * a user can now select all folders that should be included in the AppIcon
      statistics. With that feature displaying statistics is not limited to the
      INCOMING folder anymore.

2001-05-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * variable signatures will now also be used if one want`s to write a NEW or
      FORWARD a mail in a folder which belongs to a mailinglist.
    * the format of the sizes can be choosen now. That means that one can choose
      between different display formats for displaying the message & attachment
      sizes in YAM. I added 4 more different size formats that will hopefully
      fit everyones needs. Default is the standard YAM size format which was there
      since ages.
    * added forgotten Help messages for the SMTP AUTH feature of YAM.
    * fixed bug in the alignment of POP3 struct. The listview of the POP3 accounts
      didn`t show up the accounts anymore. Perhaps here we have to use a separate
      displayhook if this realignment causes trouble with MorphOS.

2001-05-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * converted _WBenchMsg to WBmsg initialised from argv
    * YAM_CO.c: removed PL_IconBody[]
    * YAM_CL.c: added here
    * YAM_UT.c: replaced stch_i() with sscanf()
    * all_gcc.c: removed usage of stch_i

2001-05-22  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Fixed Enforcer Hit when searching by status (Bug #423880)

2001-05-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * put back all fold/unfold statements (///) for our beloved GoldED users :)
      This will break Dirks plan to remove all "//" comments, but I think that`s
      acceptable. ;)

2001-05-20  Dirk Stcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * further reorganization
    * made whole code optimizable with SAS-C again (tracking down compiler bugs
      seems to get a hobby of me :-)
    * YAM_FO.c and YAM_EA.c are directly compilable now.

2001-05-20  Dirk Stcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * some more stuff. Now at least the files
      YAM_ER.c, YAM_DI.c, YAM_US.c and YAM_md5.c compile without old.h
    * And modifications I do during cleanup:
    * remove clear and bzero, replace them by memset
    * remove stccpy and replace it by MyStrCpy (which is an easy define)
    * changed all "struct Object *" to "Object *"
    * Start using enum types wherever necessary. This will improve error checking.
      All enums get names now and these are used in structures and prototypes.
    * I also started to remove the // comments and replace them by /*** xxx ***/
      or /* xxx */. I hope everyone else will do this also at code-parts he works
      on, so they will disappear very soon.
    * All structure definitions get resorted and most important all elements get
      seperate lines and type entries (Looks much better).
    * Moved all library bases to YAM.c and made them all global. No other
      declarations elsewhere (Maybe we should move these declarations to
      YAM_globals.c as Gunther suggested).

2001-05-19  Dirk Stcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * started second step of cleanup
    * replaced compiler.h by SDI_compiler.h (please don't mind Gunther, but it is
      better structured and also reflects you original design better (e.g. ASM))
    * added HOOKPROTO in YAM_hook.h and started to use it everwhere. SDI_compiler.h
      is thus nearly used from YAM_hook.h only (HOOKPROTO taken from freeciv).
    * gen_gates will no longer work, but I think this can be replaced by the
      HOOKPROTO definitions directly.
    * moved wbpath.c into YAM_UT.h
    * the header files are still not complete, but much more :-)
    * compiling with SAS will get faster again, when old.h is away. Maybe also the
      optimizing problem will disappear then?

2001-05-19  Dirk Stcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * started first step of real code cleanup (very likely MorphOS support will
      be broken for some time!)
    * gen_includes.pl will be obsoleted by proper structures. If alignment cannot
      be reached by rearranging the stuff, pad bytes maybe added.
    * added lots of header files, added 2 new directories, moved files
    * Later necessary renames (when BETA is rejoined):
      YAM_DI.c --> YAM_glossarydisplay.c
      YAM_WR.c --> YAM_write.c
      YAM_FO.c --> YAM_folderconfig.c
      YAM_MA.c --> YAM_main.c
      YAM_FI.c --> YAM_find.c
      YAM_MI.c --> YAM_mime.c
      YAM_US.c --> YAM_userlist.c
      YAM_AB.c --> YAM_addressbook.c
      YAM_RE.c --> YAM_read.c
      YAM_MAf.c--> YAM_mainFolder.c
      YAM_CO.c --> YAM_config.c
      YAM_TR.c --> YAM_transfer.c
      YAM_COs.c--> YAM_configFile.c
      YAM_COg.c--> YAM_configGUI.c
      YAM_CL.c --> YAM_classes.c
      YAM_UT.c --> YAM_utilities.c
      YAM_ER.c --> YAM_error.c
      YAM_EA.c --> YAM_addressbookEntry.c
    * The old.h files replaces the YAM.h and headers.h and should disappear very
      soon. The includes have to be in the source codes directly and the definitions
      have to be in the related header files.
    * Only really required stuff should be moved there, so we can see obsoleted
      code after this is finished.
    * A BIG SORRY FOR THE PROBLEMS THIS MAY CAUSE, BUT IT WILL BE WORTH THE EFFORT!
    * added supportfiles directory and locale directory, the make process for locales
      should be moved to locale/makefile
    * also still undone, but the makefiles should be joined in major parts!
    * NOTE: The makefiles are to be reworked totally, especially the dependencies

2001-05-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Added separate ContextMenus for the Folder Listtree and the Mail Listview.
      If popupmenu.library v9 or above could be found in the system a right
      mouseclick on the folder listtree or mail listview should pop up a nice
      ContextMenu now.

    * Fixed bug in the AB_FindTodaysBirthdates() function. Now YAM should find
      contacts who have birthday again.

    * Modified & reactivated AB_LB_CmpFunc() again. Now the addressbook should be
      sortable again.

2001-05-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Added hierarchical folder support. Now it is possible to sort the mail folders
      via a listtree and to have folder groups.
      This feature will obsolete the folder SEPARATORs. The .folders config file format
      should stay compatible.

    * It is now possible to display a 16x16 image in front of every folder. The
      image file have to have the name ".fimage" and have to be located in
      the desired folder.
      NOTE: This feature is not finished 100% and has some bug I couldn`t resolve
      yet. -> Help wanted

    * some global optimizations on the folder listtree & mail listview.

2001-05-14  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added two hidden configuration items:
      - AskJumpUnread: if set to 'N', YAM will not suggest to jump to the
        next folder with unread mails.
      - WarnSubject: if set to 'N', YAM will not display the empty
        subject line warning.
      Both defaults to 'Y'.

2001-05-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Fixed Y2K bug in DateStamp2String() function. Now Daterequests to
      UNIXTIME should perform accurate. -> fixes the export email function

    * Removed some unneeded GetLocale calls for getting the TimeZone.
      Getting the actual TimeZone is only needed once YAM is started. This
      changes should also improved the MailListview a little bit because
      The DisplayHook was calling such GetLocale calls everytime.

2001-05-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Reverted back from NFloattext.mcc to Floattext.mcc in about window

    * If you enter an alias in a address field and press return the alias
      or realname will be resolved and the complete e-mail address string
      will be printed in the field now.

    * Added eMail resolving to the address field functions so that also
      while entering a eMail address YAM will try to resolve it from the
      addressbook. The resolve & expand ording will be
      Alias->RealName->eMail.

    * Fixed mailing list stuff again. Now Shift/Alt-Reply should behave
      like before.

2001-05-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Did some cosmetic changes to the About window

    * Modified Copyright string in About window and also in every source
      file

    * NListview & NList.mcc will be used now in the Attachment part of
      the write window

    * Added Title to the window that lists each part of a message.

    * Fixed behaviour of Mailing List feature for every folder. Now the
      correct From/To etc. should be set if To: Pattern is used

    * Added Signature selection to Mailinglist feature. Now you can select
      a different signature for every mailing list.

2001-05-06  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Added backwards search to the 'change to next folder with unread
      mail' feature.

    * MA_ChangeFolder() now jumps to the first unread mail from bottom
      if reverse sorting is used in one of the sort criteria.
      This is needed for the above feature.

2001-05-01  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed enforcer hits when trying to spawn a second instance of YAM
      while the first one is starting up.

2001-04-30  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed a nasty crash bug when loading corrupted indices.  Left some
      debug info in there, since I lost the corrupted index during the
      tests.

2001-04-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * removed obsolete MCC NListtree check in addressbook code

2001-04-26  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added correct MCC version check.
    * Library open errors will now always be displayed in a requester,
      no matter if MUI is available. If possible, localized.

2001-04-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * replaced Listtree.mcc with NListtree.mcc of Carsten Scholling
    * fixed some minor bugs in the addressbook code
    * added CVS $id tags to every source file for better revision control
    * changed AppIcon to also show the unread messages of the INCOMING
      folder (this is a feature I was searching for a long time :)
    * did some small cosmetic changes to the code


2001-04-07  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Nicer compilation date in About window ("7.4.2001" -> "07-Apr-01").

2001-04-02  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Using Locale timezone setting now if available.

2001-03-21  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Offers to save the address book on quit if it was modified

    * Added some return statements to avoid warnings

2001-03-20  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Fixed enforcer hits when listing a PGP keyring with very long UID
      lines.

2001-03-19  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * When the maileditor is invoked from a readwindow this is updated
      after editing.

2001-03-17  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Added rather rudimentary LaTeX printing support

2001-03-13  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Added a warning when a mail without subject is going to be sent.

2001-03-10  Jrg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Changes for GCC/ixemul.

    * Workaround for the 'crash on editwindow close' bug added
      (YAM_UT.c/DisposeModule()).

2001-03-10  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Changed dynamic string functions in YAM_UT.c to use calloc()/free()
      instead of AllocMem()/FreeMem() and thus (hopefully) memory pools.

2001-03-08  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Fixed: potential NULL pointer referenced in StrBufCat() and
      StrBufCpy()

    * Started to improve the printing system (see RE_PrintFile())

2001-03-07  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Fixed: CheckPrinter() assumed printer on parallel port when
      interpreting printer.device status bits

2001-03-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Changed compiler options to avoid linker warning.

    * Changed default CPU target in SAS/C makefile to 68020.

2001-02-19  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * When pressing "shift right" in the read window YAM now looks
      if there are unread mails in folders after the current one
      (below the current one in the folders list).
      If there are such folders the user is asked if he wants to change
      to the first of these and continue reading there.

2001-02-19  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed memory deallocation of all mails on shutdown when
      compiling with SAS/C - based on the assumption that SAS/C uses
      memory pools in its malloc()/free() implementation.

2001-02-17  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added TYPE/N (internal format) to the STEM that ARexx command
      FOLDERINFO returns:
      0 = normal
      1 = incoming
      2 = outgoing
      3 = sent (built-in)
      4 = deleted
      5 = sent and received
      6 = sent
      Useful for ARexx scripts when deciding whether to show the "From:"
      or "To:" header line.

    * Fixed wbstart-crash, which was introduced with the removal of
      the library auto-open (on January 28th).

2001-02-15 msbethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Added external quote function to edit window (+preferences)

2001-02-14  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Address Book/New/Portrait/Select: The ASL requester title was
      "Se_lect" (same string used twice) - fixed! (Bug #131008).

2001-02-04  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed broken ARexx interface for SAS/C (introduced on January
      28th).

2001-02-04  Jrg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Fixed Utility and LocalBase types, added m68k-AmigaOS makefile
      and some other minor changes to be able to compile with GCC again.
      SAS/C users with old, broken includes have to fix them now.

2001-02-01  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed enforcer hits when encountering message headers with
      non-terminated MIME-encoded text (i.e. during a folder rescan).

2001-01-29  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added dynamic date string creation in smakefile.

2001-01-28  Dirk Stcker <stoecker@amigaworld.com>

    * Moved SAS-C make process completely into smakefile

    * Now uses original Listtree includes

2000-12-21  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed a very nasty bug when using the ARexx command MAILWRITE with
      the QUIET switch.

    * YAM would try to send mails using SMTP AUTH when a username was
      configured, even though "Use SMTP AUTH" wasn't selected. Fixed.
      Localized ESMTP error message.

2000-12-20  Jrg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Added SMTP AUTH to config GUI.

2000-12-20  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Finished slave work on menus in main window.

    * Added "Fixed font" menu item in read window to quickly switch
      font when needed. It doesn't work yet, though, since TextEditor.mcc
      doesn't seem to catch MUIA_TextEditor_FixedFont on the fly.

    * Now explicitly opens utility.library.

2000-12-19  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed .taglines bug - %'s was used for formatting, which would
      result in a "***NULL POINTER***" mess.

    * Localized all menu shortcuts in main window.

2000-12-18  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Using ARexx commands MAILWRITE and MAILSEND, while YAM is iconified
      and the external editor is configured to be spawned always, would
      throw enforcer hits. Fixed.

    * Got rid of the ANSI C time() function, which would access ENV:TZ
      each time a log entry or new mail was to be written.

2000-12-17  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * SAS/C fixes. Now compiles again, also without V44 includes.

    * Removed enforcer hits when creating new messages.

    * YAM.cd: Set max. length of commodity description to 39 characters.

    * Added sprintf() replacement with Locale support.

2000-12-10  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed custom bsdsocket.library interface - now uses the includes.

2000-12-07  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added "Reply-To:" address to folder options. Useful for folders that
      are mail aliases instead of real mailing lists, to avoid getting
      dublicate answers.

2000-12-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Enforcer hits when doing: rx "address 'YAM';info"
      (without arguments) Fixed!

    * Added "From:" address to folder options. Useful when using
      different e-mail addresses on different mailing lists.

    * When deleting a bunch of mails, and one with Disposition
      Notification pops up - new option: Ignore all

2000-11-22  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Added partial PGP multipart support

2003-01-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug #658937 where a MAILSUBJECTCHANGE arexx command
      did trash some memory if a subject larger than SIZE_SUBJECT has
      been used.
    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c, YAM_TR.c: fixed bug #659733 where the MAILCHECK
      arexx command did set the <stem>.OnServer variable not correctly.
      Previously it was just set to the amount of mails before the
      occured download, but now it correctly just shows the remaining
      mails after the download. Also recognized/fixed that after a download
      of 0 mails, the LastDL struct wasn`t set correctly, which also caused
      the MAILCHECK command to return RC 5, which wasn`t quite correct at all.
    * YAM_MAf.c: changed MA_ExamineMail() function to not use a static
      buffer for operation. That caused bug #657352 and probably was also
      the reason for some strange behaviour somewhere. Before that fix
      it was unsafe to use MA_ExamineMail() twice in a row, because the
      second call would have deleted the results of the first one.

2003-01-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #658683 where the APPBUSY arexx command
      required some text. Now you can simply call APPBUSY without any
      option and YAM will only set the application to sleep without
      placing any text in the busy region.
    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #658259 where YAM didn`t resolve names
      or aliases if they belonged to a distribution list.
    * YAM_AB.c, YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #658175 where it was
      possible that a wrong birthdate definition was passed
      through the ADDREDIT command and throwed an enforcer hit.
      Now the command returns an RC 10 code if something is wrong with
      the supplied birthdate number. In case a zero is supplied
      to the ADDREDIT command, YAM will delete the current set
      birthdate accordingly.
    * YAM_RE.c: YAM now also correctly recognized pgp signed
      messages that begin with "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE" and
      flags this messages as "signed".

2002-12-25  David Rey <david@saug.org>

    * YAM_rexx_rxcl.c: the INFO template was still wrong.

2002-12-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_rexx_rxif.c: changed the bugfix of
      bug #596303 on user demand. Previously YAM
      did always put the Application to sleep if the Busy()
      function was used. This made the usability of the
      application a bit too annoying. Now we just put
      the application to sleep (showing a busy pointer) if
      the APPBUSY arexx command will be used.

2002-12-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_DI.c: fixed bug where the listview wasn`t always
      in sync with the current Abbreviature text.

2002-12-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c/MA_GetRealSubject(): fixed bug where YAM didn`t
      correctly return the real subject if a subject line with
      brackets hadn`t got any whitespace between the last
      bracket and the real subject line. Also slightly optimized
      the function a bit.

2002-12-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c/Busy(): fixed bug #596303 and brought back the
      MUIA_Application_Sleep calls to make the Busy() function work
      again like in 2.3. These calls doesn`t seem to harm the
      performance anymore (at least with MUI 3.9) like described in
      bug #458521. And if so, this is more a problem of old MUI
      versions and not ours.

2002-12-04  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: (TC_Dispatcher) reformat loops (no code change),
      (Terminate,Initialise,main): use <= MAXWR, (SendWaitingMail): simplify
    * YAM_UT.c: (SPrintF) use va_list for non-MorphOS case too

2002-12-03  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_UT.c/YAMMUIRequest: use do/while loop, correct type of return
      value for MUIM_Application_NewInput
    * YAM.c/DoStartup: use do/while loop
    * YAM_CL.c/BC_Dispatcher: improve data->BCD handling
    * YAM.c/Initialise: use MAXWR+1 as loop count when initialising notify
      requests, main: move local variables to better scopes, fix signal mask
      (notsig2 was never waited for!), merged separate notifyrequest handling
      into one loop, StayInProg: simplify
    * YAM_UT.c/PlaySound: fix warning #120 almost without a cast,
      LoadBCImage: fix and simplify
    * YAM.c,YAM_DI.c,YAM_MAf.c,YAM_RE.c,YAM_TR.c: remove superfluous test
      before FreeStrBuf()
    * YAM_utilities.h/FreeStrBuf: use sizeof() instead of hardcoded constant

2002-12-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_CL.c: replaced multiple set() call to the same object
      with a single SetAttrs() call.

2002-12-02  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_COs.c/CO_LoadConfig: constified sortconv[]
    * YAM.c,YAM_UT.c: use EasyRequestArgs()
    * YAM.c: suppress warnings for TimerBase (different casts),
      use MAXICONS as loop count in SetupAppIcons()
    * YAM_UT.c/ExpandText: move chr[] to its usage scope
    * YAM_WR.c/WR_AddArchiveFunc: likewise
    * YAM_UT.c/(RemoveCut,IdentifyFileDT): fixed wrong static usage,
      remove unused dead code (Index), stylistic changes
    * YAM_UT.c/AllocStrBuf: use size_t as argument type
    * YAM_UT.c/StrBufCpy,StrBufCat: adapt to that change
    * YAM_rexx_rxif/rx_addrresolve: remove cast of AllocStrBuf argument
    * YAM_UT.c/AllocCopy,CompressMailFile,UncompressMailFile,CheckPrinter,
      IdentifyFileDT: miscellaneous changes
    * YAM_CL.c/BC_Dispatcher: remove test in case of MUIA_Bodychunk_UseOld
    * YAM_FO.c/FO_MLAutoDetectFunc: fixed potential enforcer hits
    * YAM_UT.c/StrBufCpy,StrBufCat: optimized

2002-12-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c/YAM_MA.c: fixed bug #635892 where
      the GETSELECTED arexx command returns wrong values
      on a use at empty folders or if a folder group was
      actually active.

2002-11-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * includes/SDI_compiler.h: added REGARGS define for MorphOS
    * Makefile/Makefile.MorphOS: added $(CPU) to LDFLAGS

2002-11-27  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_MAf.c/FO_SetCurrentFolder: fix wrong NULL usage
    * classes/Recipientstring.c: fix wrong NULL usage, drop superfluous
      strlen()
    * classes/YAM.c: fix wrong NULL usage, changed casts in
      EMailCacheNode handling
    * includes/inline/amissl_protos.h: added
    * includes/extra.h: add prototype for strdup (VBCC, STORM3)
    * classes/ClassesExtra.h: add extra.h
    * extrasrc/access.c, extrasrc/strdup.c: add
    * all_vbcc.c, all_storm.c: use it
    * all_gcc.c: disable runtime CTRL-C checking
    * Makefile: fixes and cleanup
    * VMakefile: updated

2002-11-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * includes/proto/amissl.h,includes/proto/genesis.h,includes/proto/miami.h,
      includes/proto/muimaster.h,includes/proto/openurl.h,includes/proto/pm.h,
      includes/proto/socket.h,includes/proto/xpkmaster.h: re-established VBCC
      support
    * includes/clib/socket_protos.h: add define for htons if its missing
    * YAM.c/CheckMCC: reduced stack usage and simplified it

2002-11-21  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * includes/clib/socket_protos.h: usage of sys/types.h removed
    * YAM_UT.c/CRC32: replaced dynamic CRCTable with a static const one
    * YAM_utilities.h: removed prototype for FreeCRCTable
    * YAM.c/Terminate: removed FreeCRCTable call
    * smakefile: corrected CFLAGS and LNKFLAGS

2002-11-13  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: wrap SetupDebug() into DB()
    * classes/YAM.c, classes/Recipientstring.c: use DB wrapper
    * YAM_FO.c, YAM_RE.c: no stray ";" dueto DB statements
    * Debug.h: remove empty D/SetupDebug definitions

2002-11-13  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: don't call Terminate() inside the exitfunc on a premature exit
    * YAM_MAf.c: use alignment headers

2002-11-08  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: removed "struct Device *TimerBase"
    * YAM_global.c: added it here
    * YAM_find.h: define FORMAT_DEF if its not defined

2002-10-31  AmiS <amis@amiga.org.ru>

    * Added analyse "x-senderinfo" fields and and automatically
      translate them to system codepage if "Codepage Autodetect/Translation"
      option is turn on. Mainly for cyrillic users.

2002-10-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #625377 where YAM displayed the
      first message part of a mail even if it were recognized as
      a non printable part. Remember, only the first part in
      a message will be considered the "real" message if it
      is in a printable format, if not it is recognized as
      an attachment.
    * YAM_RE.c, YAM_MA.c: fixed a possible buffer overrun
      in the DisplayHook of the Attachment requester.
      Also fixed a possible problem with attachments which
      included "%" chars - some sprintf() drove crazy because
      of it ;)

2002-10-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c: YAM_UT.c, YAM_MA.c: had to remove the LEN_DATSTRING
      from the allocations for the buffer of DateToStr() again
      and extended those buffers to 32bytes each as OS3.1 doesn`t
      seem to respect it anyhow, if used with FORMAT_DEF.
      What happend was, that in case that a .country file was used
      with returning date strings longer than LEN_DATSTRING,
      OS3.1 just overwrote our own buffers and YAM ended up in weird
      crashes. In fact this only happened with the standard
      OS3.1 italia and portugal country files as those are the only
      two that could return datestrings longer than LEN_DATESTRING.

2002-10-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_MA.c: changed buffer allocation
      constants to use the LEN_DATSTRING defined symbol
      for better clarifications in those sections.

2002-10-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_COg.c: fixed bug #624953 where YAM did provide
      the %h variable option for the reply texts in the
      configuration window where this feature isn`t quite
      possible or reasonable.

2002-10-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c, YAM_FI.c: changed the DisplayHook of the Mail
      Listview and FindWindowListview to be a NList_DisplayHook2
      so that we are able to distingush between them. We actually
      just use one Hook for both windows and this made it
      necessary to be able to distingush for some reason, like
      which column should be displayed in which window aso.
      Also added the Received/Sent date column to the findwindow
      as it seems to be of some use.
    * YAM_RE.c: reworked the Next/Prev Thread routines a bit and
      made them first search the folder of the refering mail we are
      searching from. If no followup could have been found in this
      folder, YAM will prompt the user if he really wants to
      load other index files to scan other folders. This should make
      the searching for the next/prev thread remarkable faster and
      also hopefully safer.
      Please note that there still exists the flaw that a message
      could have more than one followup to it and that YAM actually
      just search for the first followup and then immediatly displays
      the message.
    * YAM_UT.c: fixed bug in the AllFolderLoaded() function where
      YAM didn`t also check the last folder in the list.

2002-10-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * added the possibility to correctly display/sort messages
      by the date they were received/sent. Previously YAM lacked
      to correctly save and display messages if they were sorted
      by "date received".
      To fix that lack, YAM now also saves the received date
      within the .index files of the folders and in addition to
      that also within the file comment as a base64 encoded string.
      This is necessary to make it possible to rescan the index
      without loosing the exact received/sent date after the scan.
      Also it is now possible to display the sent/received date
      within the mail listview by selecting "Date Sent/Received"
      from the config [Lists] tab.
      Please note that with this new feature/bugfix it is
      _necessary_ to do a complete rescan of the .index files of
      your folders.
      This should normally automatically be covered by the last
      index version update to YIN4 - if you used a version in
      between of this two changes you will end up with "corrupt index"
      warnings which should easily be solved by doing a manual
      rescan.

2002-10-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MAf.c, YAM.c: reworked the index loading/rescanning
      routines a bit to work a bit safer.
    * YAM_COg.c: changed Layout of NewMail/Download MUI group
      a bit and disabled the automatic ghosting of the WarnSize
      gadget to make more clear that this WarnSize is not only
      dependend to the Preselection gadget.

2002-10-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c, YAM_FI.c, YAM_UT.c: changed all DateTime FORMAT_DOS
      usages to FORMAT_DEF ones. This allows YAM to preferable
      use the Locale preferences for displaying the Date in
      the Mail listview and other areas.

2002-10-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: reworked the mailheader parsing a bit to make
      things more clear and faster.
    * YAM_MAf.c: fixed bug where YAM didn`t correctly connect
      multiline headers and stripped too many spaces.
    * YAM.c: fixed bug where on a fresh start of YAM the mail
      listview was out of sync with the folderlisttree and caused
      some weird enforcer hits if the first folder in the listtree
      wasn`t actually the INCOMING folder.

2002-10-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c, YAM_read.h: replaced the numerical constants for
      the HeaderModes of the Readwindow with some more descriptive
      Symbols of "enum HeaderMode".
    * YAM_RE.c: added "[" and "]" to the allowed characters
      within a URL. This should fix problems with URLs that
      contain these characters somehow.
      Please note that placing URLs in braces like
      "[http://www.test.de/]" within a mail isn`t really a good
      idea and we count this as a user fault ;)

2002-10-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * replaced YAM_hook.h with more standarized SDI_hook.h and
      also changed the inlcude statements accordingly.
      Also updated the SDI_compiler.h to newest version.

2002-10-07  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * YAM_RE.c: Don't try to use PGP if it's not installed

2002-10-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed bug #588099 where YAM didn`t automatically
      download new mail if the "DownloadLarge" option was
      disabled within the configuration.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #617855 where YAM showed an message part
      text within the readwindow even if "Read/Show all Texts"
      was disabled in the config and the user somehow "decoded"
      the message part by selecting display or save.
    * YAM_UT.c: replaced rudimentary ComprMsgID() algorithm with
      a more unique CRC32 checksum algorithm to give the Next/Prev
      Thread function more power in finding the correct follow-up
      Message. This fixes some problems where YAM did find the
      incorrect message on a Next/Prev Thread.
      NOTE: Please note that because of this different checksum
      calculation routines, all index files of the folders have to
      be recalculated. That`s why the .index ID was increased to
      "YIN4" so that next time you open your folders YAM should
      automatically renew the index file.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug where on a FollowUp with Next/Prev Thread
      YAM didn`t correctly changed the folder and sometimes showed
      weird data.

2002-10-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c: dropped the idea of resorting the listview on
      a mailstatus change within a sorted by status listview
      again. It seems that ppl just lost track of the messageview
      somehow.

2002-09-29  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c, YAM_FO.c, YAM_UT.c: fixed bug #596302
      where the FOLDERINFO and GETFOLDERINFO arexx command still
      worked somehow on foldergroups. Also fixed the indexing
      behaviour of FOLDERINFO aswell as the foldertype
      specification.
    * YAM_FO.c: fixed bug #589038 where on a folderlist reset,
      the listtree didn`t show the foldericons afterwards and
      didn`t correctly freed the previous images.
    * YAM_FO.c: fixed bug where after a creation of a new folder,
      YAM did always show the foldergroup icon in front of the new
      folder.

2002-09-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c: fixed bug in the BusyText functions where YAM didn`t
      restore the correct previous text on a BusyEnd;
    * YAM_MA.c: YAM didn`t clear the listview if the user issued
      a index rescan. That caused some corrupt listview display
      if the user scrolled around the listview if the rescan was
      still underway.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #595017 where YAM didn`t switch to the
      correct folder and highlighted the message if a SwitchMessage()
      (Next/Prev) was done in a readwindow with a mail whos
      folder wasn`t actually active.
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed flaw where YAM did loose the track of
      messages in a readwindow when the listview was sorted by
      status and the user wanted to use Next/Prev to read other
      messages. Now YAM will not resort the listview if the
      message is currently displayed in a readwindow.

2002-09-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug where YAM didn`t resort the mail
      listview if it was selected to be sorted by status and
      the status changed somehow.
    * YAM_MA.c: changed the status sorting priorities back again
      to just take the real mail status (New/Unread/Read aso.) and
      the importance of the mail in account for sorting the mails
      or otherwise a sorting by status&date would be kinda
      confusing. For more detailed description refer to the affected
      source code parts.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed another bug within the MIME Viewer parts
      of YAM were the argument of the MIME Viewer needed some
      extra attention concerning quotation marks. Now YAM should
      be able to execute the mime viewer correctly even if the
      path to the file has some whitespaces in it. It will also
      take care of the variant if the user already used quotation
      marks within the MIME configuration.

2002-09-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c, YAM_CO.c, YAM_FI.c, YAM_MA.c, YAM_UT.c, YAM_WR.c,
      YAM_utilities.h: fixed bug #610607 where mails in a
      PROGDIR: located folder were unable to display the RAW part.
      YAM was just forwarding PROGDIR: to the third party program
      where then this programs tried to find the mailfile out of
      PROGDIR: which obviously wasn`t correct. Now YAM will always
      do a Lock()/NameFromLock()/UnLock() to get out the
      correct path to the file before executing a third party
      program (mime viewer).

2002-09-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed bug #601755 where YAM showed the overall
      transfered bytes in the transferwindow always doubled by
      the amount of mails downloaded.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #598715 where YAM didn`t display the
      letter part of a message if the user deselected "Display
      All Texts" within the Read configuration and if the
      message was a multiple MIME encoded message were we had
      to "undo" some message parts because of different msg
      boundaries. YAM wasn`t reorganizing the msg part numbers
      on a UndoPart operation and therefore lost the sync of
      the message parts somehow. This fix should perhaps also
      automatically fix some other strange behaviour were some
      MIME parts were undoed by YAM.

2002-09-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_COg.c: fixed bug #600543 where YAM will now ghost the
      according string gadget if the preselection mode doesn`t
      require any size input

2002-09-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_MAf.c: fixed bug #586671 in the folder index rescan
      routines where it could have happened that on copying
      a valid mail file into a mailfolder without YAM causes YAM to
      show up 2 equal mail files in the listview. This was caused
      because the rescan routine deleted the .index file while
      rescanning which caused YAM to loose the dirtree somehow.

2002-08-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug where the temporary unpack files weren`t
      deleted if the message was just switched within the same
      read window.
    * YAM_UT.c: fixed bug where it could have happened that
      YAM deleted the temporary unpack files (.unp) too early
      which resulted in some missbehaviour. For instance it was
      impossible to display the raw message part of a message
      that was located within a compressed folder.

2002-07-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_UT.c: reworked the FormatSize() function once more to
      now show sizes as a base of 2 for the fraction modes.
      Please note that this function will round the value
      depending on the selected precision mode - so i.e.
      102397 bytes is "100,0 KB", but "99,997 KB".
      Also slightly improved the overall performance of the
      function itself.

2002-07-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug where the SHOW arexx command
      didn`t work as expected directly after a start of YAM with
      the HIDE option.
    * classes/YAM.c: fixed bug #583098 where the emailcache
      didn`t seem to work correctly as it should. Somehow it didn`t
      add new entries to the file, and if then not to the
      correct position. Now it should always add new entries to
      the top of the list like a FILO.
      Also added some security check to the load function of the
      emailcache so that it will not read more lines than 100. In
      addition now YAM will also correctly free the whole list on
      exit.

2002-07-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed behaviour of the transfer status of the
      Transferwindow where the Gauge never really reached 100%
      even if the mail was finished.
    * YAM_TR.c: YAM didn`t issue any error message under certain
      situations while sending a mail. Now YAM should pop up a proper
      error message to signal the user that the connection was broken
      somehow.

2002-07-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM_CO.c: fixed bug #580961 where the default AppIcon Label
      wasn`t localized at all.
    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #580964 where the ADDRDELETE
      arexx command had deleted the active entry if the command
      was called with an entry that didn`t exists in the ABook
      at all. Now the command will return a WARN(5) code if the
      entry wasn`t found.

2002-07-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * YAM.c: added an additional check to the new CheckMCC
      function that will allow also broken .mcc to pass the
      test if the library version matches the one requested.
      In the particular example Toolbar.mcc is broken which
      will result in a a requester that requests the same
      version that we were searching for.
    * YAM_utilities.h: fixed bug #580966 where we lost the
      "Displayed Text" option within the save and print
      attachment requesters because of some screwed up
      flags.
    * YAM.c, YAM_MA.c, YAM_MAf.c, YAM_TR.c, YAM_UT.c,
      classes/InfoBar.c: fixed bug #557910 where the status
      icon of the infobar wasn`t in sync with the one in the
      folder listtree. Now they both should always show the
      same icon depending on the status.
      Please note that this fix could lead to additional
      flickering within the Listtree, which is a NList.mcc
      bug that is fixed within version 20.107+.

2002-07-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: added some general flags for the ->Status
      flags used within the preselection routines to make it
      easier to track down the purpose of some operations.
    * YAM_MA.c, YAM_MAf.c: changed the displayhook of the
      folder listtree and mail listview to skip certain
      operations if the user didn`t select any of the colums
      where this operations will be performed. This should
      slightly increase performance on that listviews.
    * YAM_UT.c: fixed bug #579202 where we used the wrong
      separator character for the precision sizes within the
      mail listview.
      Also fixed another bug within the FormatSize() function
      where it didn`t format sizes correctly. Now it should work
      as expected.
    * YAM_CO.c: fixed a small bug in the filter configuration
      page, where on a change from/to a Remote-Filter the
      Cycle gadget of the filter rule wasn`t notified and
      therefore showed some weird data.

2002-07-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: modified the ExtractURL function once more
      to be a bit more precise on recognizing email addresses.
      Now it should really only recognize proper email adresses
      and not any word that contains a "@".

2002-07-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: reworked the DoubleClickFunc of the Readwindow
      a bit to make it work more precise on the word the user
      really has double clicked on. This will make it possible
      for the user to double lick on two URL in the same line
      with having two separate actions to occur.
    * YAM_RE.c: Made the ExtractURL code within the ReadMessage
      functions a bit safer and also added normal email addresses
      to the recognition also. Now normal email addresses without
      a mailto: will not only be clickable within the readwindow
      they will also be highlighted like other clickable links.

2002-07-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: Undecoded message part sizes will now also be shown
      directly within the Readwindow with the ~ sign, like within
      the attachment window. This should make it more clear that the
      size of the message part isn`t known yet and that this is just
      a approximation.
    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: changed the INFO arexx command to
      require the ITEM attribute and return an error as stated
      in the arexx documentation. This fixes bug #555127
    * YAM_FO.c: fixed another enforcer hit within the ML-Autodetect
      functions that occured if only one mail was in a folder.
      This should hopefully fix this whole autodetect thing now.
    * YAM_RE.c: fixed the doubleclick on mailto: functions once
      again and now it should also recognize ?subject= attributes
      and as a special bonus I also added support for cc= and bcc=
      as defined in the HTML standard.
      It will also try to figure out "&amp;" as the separator
      between attributes. With that I recognized that also the ";"
      was missing within the legal chars of a URI because a valid
      URI can also be something like:
      "mailto:a@b.c?subject=test&amp;cc=b@c.d"
    * YAM_WR.c: reverted the Hotkeys for the Menushortcuts of
      the write window back to use CommandStrings, so that they
      will not interfere with the same hotkeys for other gadgets.

2002-07-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_FO.c: reworked the whole "Autodetect"
      feature for MLs once more and hopefully now it will be
      stable and doesn`t crash at all. Also found and fixed
      a bug within the SWS string functions. This should fix
      bug #555125 and #557784.
    * YAM_COg.c, YAM_COs.c: changed the location of the
      "New Group for addrbook entries" string gadget and added
      a MUIA_Disabled relation to the above cycle gadget to better
      point out that this two options are belonging together.
    * YAM_RE.c: the designated addressbook group for new
      automatic added entries didn`t work correctly - fixed now.
      This should fix bug #528082, even if we have to mention
      that this group will only be used if a address is added
      automatically as soon as the user reads a message.
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug #431549 where it was possible to
      interrupt a transfer by trying to use the "Check Version"
      menuitem within the Main menu.
    * YAM_MA.c: the "Show last message" menuitem will now
      be disabled by default after a startup of YAM if there
      are no pending errors somehow.
    * YAM_ER.c: fixed bug #431550 where the activation of
      the error window via the Menuitem "Show last message"
      caused a actual transfer to abort. Also enhanced
      the Error window handling a bit.
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed enforcer hit that occured on clicking
      the support URL within the About window while YAM
      was starting up. (bug #576191)

2002-07-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed bug #557524 where the doubleclick action
      on a mailto: link didn`t work anymore.
    * YAM_WR.c, YAM_CL.c: even if the Attachment NList is
      inherented from List.mui, it seems much clearer to use
      NList tags for all operations on this list. So now
      the attachment list will use NList tags when ever
      possible.
    * YAM_WR.c: fixed bug #555122 where we forgot to delete
      temporary files if an attachment that has been added to
      the attachment list of the write window was deleted
      immediatly.
    * YAM_UT.c: made our own MUI_Request() replacement even more
      compatible with some information provided by Allan.
      Now the requester should also be useable with F-keys like
      the native one and will listen to Window Closerequests also.
    * YAM_WR.c: changed the menu shortcuts for the TextEditor
      to be show up as normal shortcuts and not as CommandStrings
      as I can`t see really a good reason not to do so.
    * YAM_WR.c: fixed a tiny, but extremly nasty bug within the
      MenuStripObject for the Writewindow, that crashed a gcc
      compiled version of YAM as soon as one tried to Dispose the
      Write Window. Somehow this bug didn`t show up with SAS/C.

2002-07-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_UT.c: our own MUI_Request() reimplementation didn`t
      support a immediate exit via the "ESC" key. Now this
      should be possible like with the original MUI_Request().
    * YAM_MAf.c: did some small performance tuning to the
      MA_ExamineMail() function where we didn`t use "else if"
      constructs somehow.
      Also added a mem clearing memset() to the SaveIndex()
      function to make sure that also the reserved array of the
      index structured is somehow equal each time a index is
      regenerated.
    * YAM_TR.c: fixed small flaw in the newly introduced TCP/IP
      routines where we threw an error on the optional UIDL command
      which is not supported by all types of POP3 servers.
      There is still the flaw in YAM that if a POP3 server doesn`t
      support either TOP or UIDL command, the "Avoid Duplicates"
      option cannot somehow work and therefore we should inform the
      user about it, but as this "Avoid Duplicates" option is a
      general one for all POP3 servers in a list, we don`t bother now
      and just skip over that tiny thing, as it wouldn`t really hurt
      and otherwise it would take the user the possibility to have
      POP3 servers in his list that doesn`t support that UIDL features
      at all. We therefore should address this functionality to
      be changed within the next release and put it configurable
      for every POP3 server within the config.

2002-07-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed many major flaws within the whole TCP/IP
      routines according to some ideas from Jörg:
      1) YAM didn`t make sure that it sent/received whole command
         lines and missused some RecvDat() calls which could have
         caused some weird behaviour if receiving/sending packets
         were fragmented too much. i.e. we try to use the new
         ReadLine() function werever possible now.
      2) Reimplemented the Read/Write TCP functions to use general
         read and write buffers. Now YAM will use buffers for mail
         transfers as much as possible which could possibly speed
         mail transfers up to 100%.
      3) Improved the abort handling of the SMTP routines. Now it`s
         not possible anymore to send distorted messages by aborting
         a actual SMTP transfer.
      4) restructured the whole SMTP/POP3 command routines to use
         general identifiers for all known SMTP/POP3 commands, which
         simplified many functions and makes it easier to identify
         problems or extend the functionality in future versions.
      5) tried to improve the overall function API for all important
         TCP functions, so that they are more descriptive and open
         for future enhancements.
    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_utilities.h: replaced FreeStrBuf() function
      by a simple function macro for speed reasons.

2002-06-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed some more bugs within the transfer preselection
      routines. Mainly we forgot to filter already downloaded mail,
      even if the user aborted the transfer, this would leave
      unfiltered mail in the incoming folder.
      Secondly, the PAUSE and RESUME buttons within the preselection
      window somehow didn`t work correctly because we forgot to
      remember the last mail that was displayed within the transfer
      window. Now the whole preselection stuff should work as
      expected and a bit safer.
    * YAM.c, YAM_UT.c: fixed the recalculation routines of the
      folder listtree where it didn`t take respect of grandparent
      folder groups. If a mail within a folder had the status of
      Unread and this folder was itself also located within a full
      folder group hierarchy, all the grandparent foldergroups didn`t
      refreshed their statuses.

2002-06-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed some design bugs within the TCP/IP stuff.
      We didn`t issue a QUIT command to either the POP3 or SMTP
      server on a abort. Also fixed some enforcer hits that occured
      on aborting of transfers. This whole abort functionality
      should perform a bit better now, even if it`s implementation
      is very bad and has to be rewritten within the next release.
    * YAM.c: fixed a big flaw in the mail transfer routines
      where YAM didn`t take respect of a preselection window if
      a automatic mailcheck was selected within the Start/Finish
      section of the Config. This should fix the bugreport #555673
    * YAM.c, YAM_rexx_rxif.c: the WRITE#? and READ#? rexx commands
      were often missunderstood to work on the actual windows that
      are opened by the gui. But for these commands to work properly
      it is necessary to issue a MAILWRITE or MAILREAD command first
      to set a window active within the own arexx scope. The only
      problem that arised from the actual implementation was, that
      this scope variables were set by default to 0 and therefore
      the first opened window was the actual window this commands
      were performed on. Now YAM will set this active variables by
      default to -1 so that a user HAVE TO issue a MAILREAD/WRITE
      command before using any of the WRITE#?/READ#? commands.
      This should explain and make the reported "bugs" #555118 and
      #555120 obsolete.

2002-06-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed another flaw in the POP3 implementation of YAM
      where YAM didn`t check the statuscode of the welcome message of
      the POP3 server it was connecting to. Now YAM should pop up
      a proper error message with terminating the connection
      accordingly.
    * YAM_TR.c: fixed a small TCP/IP flaw within the APOP functions
      where YAM ignored the APOP identified supplied within the
      welcomemessage of the pop server. Now YAM should throw a
      proper error message with exiting the POP routines immediatly.
    * YAM_TR.c, YAM.cd: fixed some flaws in the ESMTP handling where
      we issued a STARTTLS command without checking previously if the
      mailer supports it or not. Also enhanced the whole ESMTP handling
      a bit, so that we can use SMTP Server extension in future easier.
      Also added some more detailed error messages to inform the user
      that a Server doesn`t support a particular selected extension.

2002-06-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM.c, YAM_TR.c: fixed missbehaviours with MUIA_Window_Activate
      where we sometimes activated the Main/Transferwindow were it
      shouldn`t be. Also fixed a bug where a MUIA_Window_Open with TRUE
      caused the window to activate if the window was already open.
      Now YAM shouldn`t interrupt the user if it`s really not
      necessary.

2002-06-22  Jacob Laursen <jlaur@mail1.stofanet.dk>

    * Improved the MCC check - now automatically attempts flushing,
      shows the version number of any existing MCC and allows for
      retrying.

2002-06-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * classes/Addrmatchlist.c: fixed bug #571831 where it could
      have happened that entries with the same Realname in the
      address matchlist caused a conflict and made it impossible
      to select the second entry.

2002-06-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * smakefile: changed SAS/C makefile to start the autogenerating
      tools automatically if something has changed. Also added
      directory variables to easily change them on compiletime.
    * YAM.c, YAM_CO.c, YAM_COg.c, YAM_COs.c, YAM_MA.c, YAM_TR.c:
      fixed a bug in the TLS/SSL recognition routines where it could
      have happen that a user selected SSL for a connection but the
      next time the amissl library is perhaps not available. In that
      situation YAM still tried to initiate a SSL connection and
      suddenly hang. Now YAM will throw a error message telling the
      user that he has selected SSL but SSL is not available right now.
      Also changed the configuration accordingly that the user can
      still disable the SSL support for those connection, but can`t
      enable it again as long as SSL is not available.
    * YAM.c: fixed bug where it could have happened that on a
      restart the AppIcon wasn`t displayed anymore.
    * YAM.c: fixed bug #560664 where YAM didn`t add the Okay
      button to the About window at initiating a restart.
    * YAM.c: fixed bug #555675 where YAM "lost" the folder group
      status on a restart of YAM.

2002-06-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Makefile.MorphOS: added stub link library calls so that YAM will
      get the correct stub functions for some STDARG functions.
      This should fix some strange hang ups when using YAM with MOS.
    * extrasrc/dice.c: removed the NO_PPCINLINE_STDARG check, because we
      cannot use the STDARG functions in there for PPC. We have to use
      stub functions instead provided by stubs libraries.
    * YAM_COg.c: added some debug information to debug the XPK a bit.
    * YAM_hook.h: added some documentation/example about the hook macros.

2002-06-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_hook.h: fixed a nasty bug within the HOOK macros for MorphOS
      that caused the whole hook stuff to freak out. :)
      Now Hooks should work as expected.

2002-06-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * reworked the handling of varargs functions within YAM to make
      it compatible/compileable with MorphOS.
      This should fix some crashes caused by misshandles vararg
      functions under MorphOS.

2002-06-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_MAf.c: fixed corrupt .index file WARNING for MorphOS.
      We simply forgot to align the .index structures for PPC. Also
      added some general ALIGN and PACKED defines to the
      SDI_compiler.h for easier use.
      NOTE: We have to be careful in future with intercommunication
      structures between 68k and PPC, so all structures that used
      directly on both plaforms (like for this .index files) have to
      be aligned for the PPC, so that this files will be compatible to
      eachother.

2002-06-10  David Rey <david@saug.org>

    * YAM_TR.c: Changed the event code issued with MSG_LOG_SendingVerbose
      to be 42.  41 was already in use by MSG_LOG_ConnectSMTP, and on the
      other hand 42 is also consistent with 32 as used by
      MSG_LOG_RetrievingVerbose
    * YAM.c: Likewise, MSG_LOG_LoggedInVerbose will use code 2 from now
      on instead of 1, which is reserved for MSG_LOG_LoggedIn

2002-06-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * all_morphos.c: removed file, because the whole libnix stuff
      of morphos is now somehow more compatible and so we can use
      the more general all_gcc.c for morphos support also
    * did some efforts on getting YAM compiled for MorphOS again.
      Updated several includes and included ppcinline includes
      to the CVS tree.
      Even if I couldn`t tested it yet, it`s compiling and linking
      correctly. So this needs some more tests until we can release
      a new MorphOS version.

2002-06-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #563641 where the ADDRDELETE function
      still didn`t work without providing an Alias. Now it should
      perform like stated in the documentation of the Arexx command.
    * YAM.h, YAM_MA.c, YAM_WR.c, YAM_write.h, YAM_rexx_rxif.*:
      change the signature of the corresponding AddSignature function
      to receive just the number of the window to add the signature to.
      That way we can easily set the Radiobutton accordingly.
    * YAM_WR.c: fixed a bug where YAM didn`t enable the correct
      Radiobutton for Signatures if the mailinglist signature
      feature was used.
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug #557522 where on a reply with a selected
      mailing list folder YAM wasn`t inserting the correct
      signature at all. Now it should insert the correct one
      depending on the mailing list variables of the folder.
    * YAM_FO.c: fixed a small, but nasty bug within the Folderimage
      allocation routines that stopped YAM somehow to show up the
      GUI if the user had just enabled one column of the Folder
      NListtree.

2002-06-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_MA.c: to be on the safe side with that ReturnID issues,
      I increased the minimum ReturnID for the Menuitems to 100,
      taking care of dynamic elements like the POP3 list.
    * YAM_utilities.h: as it seems it wasn`t that wise to
      call MUIM_Application_Input with a 0 as the signal address,
      because it still prevented it from collecting returnIDs which
      resulting in a non-working requester within the online-version
      checking.
    * #?.c: removed a whole bunch of gcc warnings. Mainly some
      suggested paratheses and wrong format descriptions.
      Nothing really serious and cross-checked with SAS/C.
    * Makefile: Changed the Makefile to be more compatible to the
      SAS/C smakefile. Now the invocation should be somehow the
      same, especially for creating non-debug versions.

2002-06-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Makefile, inline/#?: Did some efforts to get YAM compiled
      with gcc again, as we will need that in future for sure.
    * YAM_AB.c, YAM_RE.c: also added the capslock (fix) to other
      places like the addressbook and read window to allow the user
      to still use his keys with a turned on capslock.

2002-05-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM.c: fixed bug #556531. YAM will now also execute the
      Start&Stop Macros, as defined within the configuration, at
      initiating of a "Restart".

2002-05-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_MA.c: YAM treats (SHIFT)+DEL keypresses with a turned on
      CapsLock like without Capslock now. This should improve the
      usability a bit, because it can happen quite often that a user
      enables the caps lock errounously while typing around.

2002-05-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM.c, YAM.cd: added a more descriptive error message about
      the minimum requirement versions of MCCs and reworked the Abort()
      routines a bit
    * YAM.c: raised minimum requirement version for NList.mcc to
      v20.104 and NListtree v18.12 as this versions fixes some bugs
      that would otherwise make YAM unstable.
    * YAM_UT.c: reimplemented the original MUI_Request() function
      in a more secure, reliable way. This fixes some LONG READ
      enforcer hits as it seems that the original MUI_Request()
      is quite broken and shouldn`t be used at all.

2002-05-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #555128 where YAM didn`t return
      the default screenname "Workbench" on issueing a INFO screen
      rexx command, if it was iconified.
    * YAM_CO.c: fixed bug #556527 where the signature cyclegadget
      didn`t work anymore because of a incorrect return.

2002-05-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_AB.c: added a more sophisticated error handling to the
      LoadTree() function to return a proper error message even
      if the file exists but isn`t accessible at all.
    * YAM_FO.c: the bug #555117 wasn`t completly fixed because
      FO_GetFolderRexx() still counted groups as folders.

2002-05-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #555126 where the USERINFO arexx
      command also counted folder groups as real folders.
    * YAM_FO.c, YAM.cd: fixed bug #555123 by adding new localization
      strings for the Edit Folder group String requester.
    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #555117 where using the NEWMAILFILE
      arexx command worked on groups, which was obviously wrong.
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug #555116 where calling the RescanIndexHook
      on a folder which isn`t really a real one (FT_GROUP) caused
      the creation of a bogus .index file at PROGDIR:
    * YAM_rexx_rxif.c: fixed bug #555115 where the MAILREAD
      rexx command didn`t activate a readwindow as stated
      in the documentation.
    * YAM_AB.c: fixed bug/flaw #555113 by adding additional
      checkings and a requester to inform the user that YAM
      will process a non YAM addressbook file as a newline
      separated file of email addresses.
    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_utilities.h: added a wrapper function to
      implement a MUI_Request() in a secure way. Also added a
      wrapper #define for MUI_Request() to automatically use
      the new YAMMUIRequest() function.
    * YAM_FO.c, YAM_US.c, YAM_UT.c, YAM_utilities.h:
      introduced some special macros COLLECT_RETURNIDS and
      REISSUE_RETURNIDS to handle some problems with overlapping
      ReturnID values at the usage time of MUIM_Notifys with
      MenuActions.

2002-05-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_AB.c: fixed bug #555112 where we cleared the Listtree before
      we checked if the file can be opened and therefore could have
      lost the whole addressbook if it wasn`t loadable at all.
    * accordingly to recent discussions in the dev-ML I added some
      general flag handling macros to YAM_utilities.h and spread
      them all over the sources. With this macros flag handling
      should be simplified a bit and hopefully they will also reduce
      the risk of handling flags incorrect.
      In addition to that general flag macros every flag itself has
      now some kinda "check-macro" where the current state can be
      checked by accessing it`s is/has macro which always returns
      TRUE or FALSE accordingly to the actual state.

2002-05-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added #define vars for the rule actions in YAM_main.h and
      spread them all over the sources to deal with symbolic names
      instead.
    * YAM_CO.c: changed the AddRule button behaviour a bit, so
      that it will now automatically activate the name stringgadget
      and autoselect any string in there. This should be a bit more
      handy for the user.
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug where a Remote-Filter executed actions
      it was not supposed to do and it was also possible to fire
      a remote filter were it shouldn`t have been possible at all.
      i.e. on the Filter button in the main window aso.

2002-05-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM_TR.c: fixed bug where we didn`t checked the result code
      of a TR_SendCMTPCmd() call and therefore placed the mail in
      the wrong folder on an error.
    * added a proper status message to the connecting process of
      the SMTP send commands. Now YAM will show a message that
      it is trying to connect to the SMTP server. Formerly
      there were no status message at all informing the user
      about what is next.

2002-05-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * change the title generation of the MailContextMenu to show
      a subset of the Sender/Recipient instead of the Mailfile
      number.

2002-05-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added a Busy() call to the POP transfer functions so that
      the user still has a indicator what`s going on if he has
      enabled time depending mail checking.
    * fixed another bug in the ADDRRESOLVE rexx command where it
      was also checking the emailcache what is not supposed to
      happen with the command.
    * fixed bug #552414 where the creations of a Recipientstring
      object in the ADDRRESOLVE rexx command caused some enforcer
      hits later because we were refering to the renderinfo of that
      object where obviously is not renderinfo at all.
    * fixed bug #552395 where we forgot to set a pointer to a
      empty string by default to prevent a NULL pointer hit.
    * got rid of the SAS/C portability warnings #120 by modifying
      the code a bit. Now #120 warnings are turned on in the
      smakefile also.

2002-05-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug #551543 where we didn`t check for a NULL pointer in
      YAM_AB.c - AB_GotoEntry().

2002-05-01  David Rey <david@saug.org>

    * YAM_WR.c: updated the URLs given by the MIME warning in
      WR_ComposeReport.

2002-05-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * changed internal busy gauge handling a bit. Now there is the
      possibility to have multiple BusyLevels (maximum defined by
      BUSYLEVEL). This makes it possible to show a information at the
      Infobar and by ending it with BusyEnd, it will print the previous
      message that occured.
      This also fixes some bugs were we wanted to show the user some
      information but it was not possible because a previous Busy state
      wasn`t closed by BusyEnd.
    * fixed a small flaw in the PGP recognition stuff. Now YAM will
      explicitly flag a message as crypted/signed if it couldn`t be
      found out initially by scanning the header while downloading
      the message. Now YAM will flag this message as crypted/signed
      along with flagging the folder it resists in as modified.

2002-04-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed (worked-around) the bug #534430. I call this "worked-around"
      because it seems that if the autocorrect feature of TextEditor.mcc
      is turned on and we close the amissl.library within YAM somehow,
      something gets really wrong within YAM which results in strange
      crashes/lock ups as soon as the autocorrect feature gets initiate
      from within the TextEditor.mcc. I really couldn`t see any dependency
      between closing amissl.library and this lock ups within texteditor.mcc,
      but simply keeping the amissl.library open for the lifetime of YAM
      solved the problem somehow.
    * added a error message to the import mail function to tell the user
      that a selected file doesn`t contain any mails.
    * fixed bug in GetMailFile() utility functions where a -1 assignment
      to a folder wasn`t checked. This fixes a bug in the import mail
      handling as well as in other places.

2002-04-29  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * reverted the fix #508202 because as it pointed out this wasn`t
      really a bug at all.
    * changed some of those small utility functions to act as macros.
    * fixed a nasty bug in the multipart handling code where we forgot to
      close the output file on a error condition. That resulted in a
      crash if we tried to open that mail several times.

2002-04-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed some possible errors with not checking the result of Examine()
      all over at different places. Now this functions should really perform
      a bit more secure on this.

2002-04-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug in the mail listview display hook were it was possible that
      the status flag wasn`t displayed/screwed because of a too long Address
      column.

2002-04-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed serious bug in hmac_md5() function were we replaced bcopy() with
      memcpy() and overwritten the key string, because a bcopy() is per
      define a memmove(). Now the CRAM-MD5 authentification with ESMTP
      servers should work again.

2002-04-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed a TCP/IP issue flaw within the TR_Connect() function were it could
      have happened that if a particular host has 2 different IPs in the
      DNS and the first was down, YAM didn`t try to connect to the other one
      instead and just reported a error.

2002-04-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed behaviour of status flag ordering again a bit. Now it should
      really perform like stated within the documentation
    * fixed another mailfile-doesn`t-exists bugs concerning mail copying
      and transfering to another folder. Now YAM should throw proper
      error messages instead.
    * fixed more possibly bug issues on the mailfile-doesn`t-exist fact
      because the result code from MA_ExamineMail() wasn`t checked
      everywhere probably.
    * fixed bug #461926 by throwing an error requester now, informing the
      user that YAM tried to open a mail file that doesn`t exists anymore
      but is still listed in the folder.

2002-04-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug #480905/505857 by changing the temporary file handling like
      described below and also by just opening a eventually unwriteable file
      with just read because it is locked by another application (viewer)
    * changed behaviour of the temporary file handling a bit to make it more
      secure. Now YAM not only identifies tempfiles by the window and part
      number, it also takes the serialzed ID of the mail itself, so this
      tempfiles should be really unique while mail reading which will
      fix many issues/bugs that are related to that old restriction/flaw.

2002-04-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug #528105 that was caused because of the usage of one shared
      displayhook for the maillistview and the findmaillistview in the find
      window. Now we just set MUIA_NList_DisplayRecall to inform both listview
      of this situation.
    * fixed a small flaw in the Mail Listview display hook were YAM could have
      been displaying empty From: strings when a user/group doesn`t have a name
      within the addressbook. Now it just displays the email instead.
    * changed behaviour of Folder Listtree according to doubleclick events a
      bit. If the user now double clicks on a folder group it will just fold
      or unfold the tree and not popup the change requester for it. This
      feels a little bit better because in the past it could happen that
      on a doubleclick for fold/unfold the requester poped up aswell which
      was quite annoying.

2002-04-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed some problems with setting a folder active without opening the
      parent node in the hierarchical system. This kills bug #528080
    * fixed behaviour of LISTSELECT arexx command to really select/deselect all
      messages as described in the documentation. Fixes bug #508202
    * fixed some possible bugs in the arexx interface were it could happen that
      it did some harmful stuff with invalid ActiveWriteWindow values. Now these
      situations just returns an RETURN_ERROR instead.
    * the MAILWRITE command will now return a RETURN_WARN if the user tried to
      send WINDOW value other than 0 or 1.
    * changed behaviour of Arexx commands that will set a write window active.
      If now the command is executed without QUIET, the window will really go
      active. This should fix some confusion about this behaviour as well.
      This should kill one bug of ticket #466021
    * fixed bug #506533 where YAM didn`t jump to a new message when a ghosted
      folder was selected before.
    * fixed another enforcer hit that occured on filtering mails by msgbody or
      header.

2002-04-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed occuring enforcer hits in the filter routing where YAM caused some
      hits when you were filtering by message body. bug #528631
    * fixed the Status flag sorting routine accordingly to bug #474525
    * increased the max. string size for email adresses to 150 and for NAMES to 30
      That should fix bug #460430 and #511259.
    * fixed bug #456134 accordingly that it will only display the senderinfo if
      there is only one person with that realname in the Addressbook.
    * changed email string gadgets in Filter settings to use the ResolveString
      string gadget.
    * fixed bug in AttachRequest() function where it could happen that if the
      user did 2 same attachment requests it returned a partlist that the user
      hasn`t even selected. fixes bug #433800

2002-04-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * did some minor cosmetic change to the send window accordingly
      to bug #433765

2002-03-02  David Rey <david@saug.org>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed the duplicated "shift right" menu shorcut
      (bug #440010)

2002-02-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_AB.c, YAM_CL.c, YAM_CO.c, YAM_COg.c, YAM_COs.c, YAM_EA.c, YAM_FI.c,
      YAM_FO.c, YAM_MA.c, YAM_MAf.c, YAM_RE.c, YAM_TR.c, YAM_UT.c, YAM_WR.c:
      converted TABs to spaces
    * includes/inline/muimaster.h: switched to macro based inlines
    * YAM_TR.c: removed AmiSSLBase definition
    * YAM_global.c: added here

2002-02-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed smakefile accordingly to new genclasses changes.
      Now YAM should be compileable with SAS/C again.

2002-02-21  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_FI.c/FI_SearchPatternInBody: fix typo
    * YAM_MI.c/outdec: fix GCC warnings

2002-02-21  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * extrasrc/genclasses: updated for new headername convention
    * classes/Addrmatchlist.c,classes/InfoBar.c,classes/Recipientstring.c,
      classes/Searchwindow.c,classes/YAM.c: adapt includes for new naming
      convention

2002-02-20  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * libraries/pm.h: fixed GCC warnings about anonymous unions
    * proto/amissl.h: added support for different compilers
    * inline/amissl.h: added
    * extrasrc/dice.c: added AMISSL stub functions

2002-02-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added new JumpToIncoming hidden option and set it by default
      to FALSE. If enabled YAM will jump to new incoming messages
      after retrival.

2002-01-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * the listview in the find window will be sorted by date by
      default now. This makes more sense then sorting by filename
      like it did before.
    * updated the X-Mailer header to reflect 2002.

2002-01-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug in the listview display of the glossary. Now YAM
      should again display every glossary item correct.

2002-01-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug where YAM lost the LastActive variable which normally
      saves the last active entry in a mail folder and jumps to this
      position if the folder is activated again.
    * YAM now also jumps to a new received message after getting
      all mail from the POP servers with respect to the JumpToNewMsg
      option.
    * changed copyright note to reflect the new year 2002.

2001-12-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * removed support@yam.ch email from About window on request
      from Marcel Beck.
    * reworked the YAM.cd a bit.

2001-12-16  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * YAM_EA.c: Added missing MUIA_ControlChar to security cycle

2001-12-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * the SWSSearch() function requires more stack than I thought and
      so I increased it to obtain 65535 bytes to be on the safe side.
      This fixes the enforcer hit that occured on the use of the new
      autoguess feature for MLs.

2001-12-11  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * YAM_RE.c: fixed crash when the edit window was opened from
      a read window and the read window was closed before clicking
      "Send Later", "Send Now" or "Hold" in the write window.
      Fixes Bug #481316

2001-12-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * we use a Recipientstring for the return address specification
      in the configuration of AB Lists now.

2001-12-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug in email cache that caused that new entries weren`t
      added to the cache if it was already filled up completly.
    * the email cache check routines for the addressbook now only
      check for a existing AB entry with the email address because we
      don`t want to have duplicate entries in the AB and EmailCache.

2001-12-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added support for emailcache resolving in recipientstrings.
      Now YAM should also fully resolve a email adress out of the
      email cache if the user press return.

2001-12-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * the incoming folder appicon stats is now enabled by default if not
      explicitly disabled in the folder config. (Bug #484553)
    * fixed a not localized string in the MIME import functions
      (Bug #441917)
    * changed drag&drop routines of folder NListtree accordingly that
      if the user tries to drop a mail to a folder it should only appear
      if he has the mouse over the folder and not above or below it.
      Also changed the DragReport routines that if the user drops a
      folder onto another folder a sign should not appear and only drops
      below or above should be allowed.
      Concerning the MAIL->FOLDER drop routines there seems to be still a
      flaw in NListtree because it`s somehow still possible to drag a mail
      in between of two folder but it will then be moved to one of those.

2001-12-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * removed the tiny font from the Autodetect button in the folder
      configuration following the MUI Styleguide.
    * reapplied the tiny font in the info bar.

2001-11-25  AmiS <amis@amiga.org.ru>

    * Added "Codepage Autodetect/Translation" option.
      If this option is enabled, YAM will statistically analyse
      message text, from/to/subject fields and MIME text/* attachments
      (independently) and automatically translate them to system codepage.
      Mainly for cyrillic users.  See guide for detailed description.

2001-11-22  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Commas inside quotes are now accepted as valid characters in
      recipient strings.

2001-11-20  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * (YAM.c/InitLib): changed return type to APTR for better NDK
      compatibility and removed cast of InitLib() calls
    * YAM_global.c: unified yamversion#? strings

2001-11-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * removed a unneeded error message in the SMTP send routines
      as the TR_SendSMTPCmd() always throws out errors on failure.

2001-11-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added SMTP SSL/TLS support through AmiSSL accordingly to
      (RFC 2487)
    * fixed bug in the SMTP routines where it happened that
      if a SMTP AUTH request wasn`t succesfull we forgot to
      disconnect from the server.
    * fixed a bug in the SMTP AUTH routines where the server response
      wasn`t displayed to the user on a authentication failure.
    * made some cosmetic code changes to the SMTP AUTH part.
    * added possibility to explicitly specify the POP3 and SMTP Port
      in a string gadget in the configuration.
    * added POP3 SSL/TLS support for stunnel servers (port 995) and
      also POP3-server that supports the STLS command set like
      suggested in (RFC 2595)
    * implemented optional TLS/SSL support by using AmiSSL library
      from Andrija Antonijevic, which is a public AmigaOS port
      of OpenSSL (RFC 2246)

2001-11-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed a security flaw in YAM where it was possible that a user
      received a mail with special escape sequences in the Mail header
      that were interpreted by MUI. And with additional knowledge
      about PIPE mechanisms it was possible to execute real commands
      that could harm the system!
      YAM now strips out those escape sequences in the header of a
      mail as soon as it receives them.

2001-10-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug where a empty ", ," string in a recipient gadget were
      resolved as the whole AB.
    * on resolve, if a realname doesn`t exists in the AB, the recipient
      resolve feature only completes the address with the email.
    * if more than one entry for a recipientstring is found in the
      addressbook the Resolve routines doesn`t just take the first
      one for resolving, they now stop resolving it.
    * fixed a little flaw in the recipientstring class where it
      wasn`t possible to select the correct recipient if more
      than one entry with the same realname was found in the
      addressbook.
    * Parts in a multipart mail will now be displayed colored to
      indicate that they are clickable.

2001-10-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * YAM now also brings all windows to the front if the AppIcon
      is doubleclicked while the main window is open.
    * implemented match & save functions for new emailcache
      feature. Now YAM should save/move entries in the emailcache
      list to the corresponding file. This finally finishes the
      emailcache feature.

2001-10-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added functions/methods to use the new emailcache on a
      recipientstring. Moved match function from the addrmatchlist
      to the YAM main subclass like proposed in the mailinglist.
    * added config entry and GUI elements for upcoming emailcache
      feature. Also reconfigured some GUI elements to use a
      NumericbuttonObject.

2001-10-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added feature to try to automatically detect the mailinglist
      pattern and To: field by integrating the Smith&Waterman
      algorithm for a string similarity search.
      YAM will try to detect the pattern from the first 5 messages
      in a folder and only if the pattern is != #? it will be
      placed into the pattern string gadget.
      This should make it easier to enter the correct mailinglist
      pattern.
    * by default we disable the ML support for the standard folders
      like INCOMING/OUTGOING/SENT/DELETED.
    * the mailinglist support of every folder can now be explicitly
      enabled/disabled

2001-10-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * the folder configuration window now also uses YAM`s standard
      Addressfield string for the ML support.

2001-10-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * changed InfoBar label refresh not to refresh the folder image
      also, because this causes some unnecessary flickering while
      opening a read mail window.
    * added user ability to define the InfoBar label with own text
      and inputs from a folder. This finishes the missing features
      of the new InfoBar.

2001-10-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed enforcer hit that happened on a manual filter operation.
    * added ability to configurate the position of the new Infobar
      along with the ability to disable it completly.
    * changed catalog description for the new introduced size formats
      in YAM, because they were a bit strange :)

2001-10-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed another bug that caused the insert of a wrong signature
      if a user replied to a message that resisted in the incoming
      folder.
    * fixed a tiny bug in the StripSignature routines were it could
      have happened that a signature doesn`t get stripped.

2001-10-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed another bug in the ML support were it happened that on a
      reply of a mail without a ReplyTo: field the mail were sent
      to the mailinglist and the sender.

2001-10-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug #468896 where the old Folder/Order/Reset option caused
      a serious crash of YAM.
    * added reload tree option to the folder context menu
    * switched off automatic sorting of the folder listtree because it`s
      not supported yet.
    * Added/Created new InfoBar class, removed the bottom gauge bar and
      made this InfoBar a default setting.
      This new InfoBar combines the old first version of the InfoBar
      together with the bottom GaugeBar and Busy texts/gauges are only
      displayed if necessary.

      This InfoBar class is NOT finished yet and there are still some
      unimplemented features like:
      - user configurable InfoBar position (Top/Center/Bottom)
      - user configurable Folder text (number of new mails etc.)

      The new style of this InfoBar is not finished yet and any suggestion
      is welcome.

2001-09-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed another bug in the folder listtree were on a drag&drop mail
      move operation the incorrect folder was refreshed if a folder
      group was fold.
    * fixed bug in folder listtree were it wasn`t possible to drag any
      mail to another folder if one of the folder groups were fold.

2001-09-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug #432328 where the wrong image was displayed if a folder
      was a password protected one.
    * fixed bug #450062 where the index of some folders wasn`t displayed
      because only visible entries of the Listtree were selected to be
      displayed.

2001-09-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug #432331 where it happened that, if no action was performed
      at the start of YAM that caused the AppIcon to refresh, no AppIcon
      was displayed at all.
    * fixed bug #459478 where MyStrCpy() was used with a string pointer
      while MyStrCpy() doesn`t accept string pointer, which will result in
      a broken string copy.

2001-09-12  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * YAM_RE.c: Now accepts "(" and ")" in URLs also
      (according to RFC 1738, ";" are also allowed in some cases
       but not yet added)
      Fixes Bug #460488

2001-09-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * commented MUIA_Application_Sleep calls in Busy() function. This is the
      cause for bug #458521. This busybar stuff anyway will be reworked
      completly if the new infobar is finished which will replace this
      bottom busybar.
    * modified makefile to reflect new genclasses tool
      Now you can directly compile the genclasses tool by specifing
      the smakefile target "GenClasses".
      You can also execute the genclasses tool to auto-generate
      all necessary sourcesfiles with the target "ClassInfo".
    * modified class sources to be compatible with the new genclasses
      tool from Andrew.

2001-09-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added error message to move mail filter operation if it tries
      to move a mail to a folder that couldn`t be found by name.
      This can happen if a filter rule exists and the user renames
      a folder. Now a error message pops up and tells the user that
      this operation failed !
    * added missing localization to the newfoldergroup requester.
    * fixed bug #433745 where YAM was not displaying the check.info
      icon anymore.
    * fixed bug #433751 that caused flickering of the AppIcon after
      recalculating the statistics.
    * added standard source headers to new classfiles
    * set emailcache filename lowercase with a uppercase assign.

2001-08-22  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * When using D(DBF_ERROR, ()) then a DisplayBeep() is issued.
    * The FindUserData-hook used to resolve email aliases is now restricted to
      only find matches of type AET_USER or AET_LIST.

2001-08-05  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Added loading of email cache in OM_NEW of new application subclass.
    * Added Debug.c and Debug.h to the repository. The system is used like
      this (notice no \n and no ;):
             D(DBF_ALWAYS, ("this value is %ld", val))
      When DEBUG isn't defined this turns into ';', so you can write:
             for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
                D(DBF_ERROR, ("invalid item: %ld", a[i]))
      I.e. without using braces.
      DBF_ALWAYS is used for stuff that must always be shown. DBF_ERROR when
      something fails. DBF_VERBOSE is for generally interesting messages which
      doesn't really fit a category. The rest of the flags has to be added
      when required. They should be categorized, i.e. no flag for 'my fancy
      feature', but instead a flag for i/o, network stuff etc.
      You enable debug output with "SetEnv YAMDebug «flags»". Flags is a
      comma, space or semi-colon separated list of stuff you want enabled.
      E.g. "io, verbose, error". You can also enter "all" to get everything
      enabled.
      Currently 'always' and 'error' are enabled by default (and can't be
      disabled).
    * Some styleguide changes.
    * Changed version string to say 'dev' instead of 'devel'.
    * Added an application subclass which is now used.

2001-08-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * ContextMenus now also open in areas where no mail/folder is, so that this
      popupmenus can be used to generate at least a new folder/group or mail.
    * If a context menu is opened on a already active entry the maillist will
      not be refreshed anymore. This should reduce flickering at least on
      already active entries.

2001-08-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Now respects the "Iconified on startup" MUI setting. If the HIDE
      tooltype is present, it'll override it.

2001-08-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * the delete folder menu item & context menu entry does not allow to remove
      the incoming/deleted/sent/outgoing folder anymore. This was the standard
      behaviour before the hierarchical folder system was added and was broken.
      This fixes bug #445602 also.
    * if a folder group is going to be deleted YAM will pop up a requester now
      asking the user to confirm if it is not empty. If this folder group
      contains any subfolders or another group, then this subentries will be
      moved to the parent folder of the group first.
    * reverted changes to the resolve method of the recipientstring to reduce
      complexity of the code. (who requested this... guess?)
    * turned the ChangeLog upsidedown. Now the newest entry should always be
      attached to the top because this is more natural.

2001-08-05  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Fixed enforcer hit in Recipientstring class («censored»).
    * ResolveOnCR defaults to FALSE similar to AdvanceOnCR.
    * Pressing 'delete' in a recipient string will now delete close the popup
      list.
    * The mails in the main listview are now shown to be from the real name
      of the sender found in your addressbook (this name should also be used
      when replying to the letter and composing the greeting phrase, but is
      currently not).
    * Removed classes/Classes.h dependency from class sources!
    * Added ClassesExtra.h file.
    * Added section about tags and compact switch/cases to the styleguide.
    * Moved the address list popup window to its own class.
    * The adddress list popup window will now adapt to the position and size
      of the parent window, when changed.
    * Escape will now close the address matchlist popup window (and
      MUIKEY_WINDOW_CLOSE is disabled for the recipient string as long as the
      window is open).

2001-08-02  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Recipientstring class no longer sets the frame, cyclechain or 'advance
      on cr' tags.
    * Ensured that all source descriptions are now prefixed with ' Module:'.
      This allows e.g. to do a »Search YAM_#?.c "*N Module:"« to see the
      description of each source file.

2001-08-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added a MUIA_Recipientstring_NoResolve attribute to the recipientstring
      class. If this attribute is set to TRUE the recipientstring is not going
      to perform a resolving on the entered string, what means in fact that it
      will not transform it with a realname or something else.
    * fixed some bugs recently introduced to the recipientstring class.
    * the recipient string class now only set the focus on the next object
      if the MUIA_String_AdvanceOnCR is set.
    * renamed the MUIA_Recipientstring_Resolve_NoResolve to _ResolveOnCR
      accordingly to some discussions.
    * renamed GetMUI() function to xget() because this is a more "standard"
      name for this function.
    * the ShowMatches() method of the recipient string class is now using
      SetAttrs() for setting the list position.
    * added EXPORT statement for the MUIF_ flags to the recipient string class
      to allow the autogen tool to take care about this.
    * removed obsolete DD_String class stuff including WR_ResolveName() and
      WR_ExpandAddresses()
    * modified smakefile to reflect every dependency for the classes.

2001-08-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * changed RETURN, SHIFT+RETURN behaviour as discussed in the mailing list.
      Now YAM should resolve any entered string without the realname if the user
      press SHIFT+RETURN in a recipientstring gadget.
    * changed the string gadget checks if a mail is going to be sent accordingly
      to the above behaviour. Now YAM will pop up an error requester if a user
      tries to send a email and it can`t resolve any entered string or if the
      From: is missing.
    * YAM will also change the focus of the pagegroup and string gadget that
      produced the failure, so that the user can immediatly change it.
    * added From: is missing warning requester. Now YAM will warn the user that
      the From: string is empty and allow him to either use the default sender
      address from the config or reenter the string again.
    * fixed bug in recipient string where the position of the popuplist was not
      set everytime it was opened. This caused that if the window was moved in
      between of two popups, then the popuplist was displayed on a wrong position.
      Still one flaw:
      1)if the window is moved while the popuplist ist open, then the popuplist
        will not move it`s position in sync with the window.

2001-08-01  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_rexx.c (global): added REXXMSG macro to hide annoying NDK difference
      (ReplyRexxCommand, DoRXCommand): use it
    * YAM_rexx.c: small cleanups

2001-07-31  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Addressbook popup gadget is no longer in cyclechain as you can popup the
      book with the standard MUI popup key (defaults to ctrl-p) -- I really
      would prefer to turn it into a real Popstring gadget, but currently the
      hook to open the address book require both global and local info etc.
    * Each change of the recipient string will result in an attempt of
      completing the address which is in front of the cursor. Earlier e.g.
      deleting a character wouldn't.
    * The recipient class now has a tag for "allow multiple recipients". This
      is enabled for the From and Reply-To strings (which it wasn't earlier).
    * The recipient class has a method to resolve the names entered. The
      MakeRecipients() function setup a notify on MUIA_String_Acknowledge to
      call this method.
    * When resolving a list then it will recursively continue to expand
      members of this list so one can have a list of lists. Though this is
      currently limited to 5 recursions.
    * The 'resolve' gadget has been removed (since it happens on return anyway
      in the writewindow) and thus the 'focus on return' scheme has been
      removed entirely.
    * There's now a popup list when YAM attempts to complete what the user is
      typing in a recipient string. It contain 3 columns for alias, real name
      and address. The entire string of the column which match what the user
      is entering is in bold, though limited to SIZE_ADDRESS characters due
      to the static display hook buffer. The list is sorted accodring to which
      field match and secondly alphabetically.
    * Using arrow up/down when the popup list is open immidiately change the
      contents of the string gadget and pressing return will act as if the
      popup wasn't shown (i.e. it will be interpreted by the gadget, so
      MUIA_String_Acknowledge will go high).
    * As with the old class one can enter a comma while text is marked (during
      a completion) and the comma will be inserted behind the marked text
      instead of overwriting it.
    * The alias, real name and address stringgadgets of the addressbook (new
      user, new list and new group windows) no longer accept comma as a valid
      character.
    * The stringgadget for entering list members (in the list window of the
      addressbook) is now a Recipientstring. It doesn't auto-transform on
      return (since often you want the alias in the list, so that a change to
      the address of this alias will also affect the list). Also, it currently
      lack the addressbook gadget. This is only because I was lazy when I
      added it... we could just cut'n'paste the code from MakeRecipient(), but
      I want this Recipientstring to instead be a popuplist which handle the
      addressbook itself.
    * Put the Okay gadget in the (stupid) subject warning requester as default
      (didn't I already do that?).
    * Trim() now accepts a NULL pointer (returns NULL).
    * Added a STR() define to YAM_utilities.h. This transforms a define into a
      string. This is useful e.g. if you do sprintf and want to limit the
      string length to that of a define. E.g. in the AB_PrettyPrint() function
      I do the following:
         static TEXT buf[SIZE_REALNAME + SIZE_ADDRESS + 4];
         sprintf(buf, "%." STR(SIZE_REALNAME) "s <%." STR(SIZE_ADDRESS) "s>",
            e->RealName, e->Address);
    * Added DUFF define to smakefile -- I'll soon remove the define, but my
      code has made a lot of functions obsolete and I'm going to wait a little
      before I start to remove all this code (which is currently marked by an
      #ifndef DUFF).
    * One can go back in the recipientstring gadget and change previous
      entries, even with name completion (earlier that would delete the rest
      of the string). The completion will only kick in if the character under
      the cursor is '\0' or ','.

««« Some bugs/flaws which remain: »»»

[FIXED] ADDRRESOLVE arexx command is currently broken. Reason is that I have
        retired the WR_Resolve() function which this command require. Suggested
        solution is that the command simply create a Recipientstring objectc,
        set the alias as contents in this object and calls the
        MUIM_Recipientstring_Transform method.
[FIXED] When using a list in the To gadget then the From and Reply-To fields
        won't be changed to that setup in the addressbook. Reason: this was
        really a hack before IMHO (testing various pointers to figure if and
        where to set the new strings). Also, some problems arise if letter is
        sent to multiple lists. Suggested solution would be to introduce
        two tags which tell the recipientstring object which object(s) it should
        propagate the (new) From and Reply-To addresses.
      * When typing the last character of an alias (while the popup list is
        open) then the popup list won't close. Reason being that the
        Recipientstring class doesn't notice that the string change (user
        overwrites last marked character with same character).
      * There's currently no warning requester when one of the recipient strings
        can't resolve the names (but a DisplayBeep(NULL) and a
        "DB(kprintf();)").

    * Renamed MUIM_Recipientstring_Transform method to
      MUIM_Recipientstring_Resolve for consistency with the rest of the YAM
      source.
    * Fixed ADDRRESOLVE arexx command further. Btw: this command would earlier
      (YAM 2.2) return a random string on failure.

2001-07-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug #440000. Now the NListtree default foldergroup icons will be
      displayed if one of the folder_fold/unfold images are missing.
    * fixed bug #445715. YAM should now not change the Track Message flag if
      a message is going to edit.
    * WR_WriteUserInfo() now takes respect of the alternative selected From:
      address of the folder the mail was created in.

2001-07-29  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Rewrote the eventhandler of the recipient string. The new code should be
      much simpler and thus more transparent.
      Some functionality still lack and it needs some finetuning (e.g.
      multiple recipient support)...

2001-07-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Changed code layout of the new classes files accordingly to the standard
      layout of YAM and added the fold/unfold marks.

2001-07-28  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Moved the Recipient String class to its own file
      (classes/Recipientstring.c) and added a popup window when multiple
      candidates exist for address completion. Some functionality is still
      pending (you can navigate the list with arrow up/down but return just
      does a DisplayBeep()) -- you need to define DUFF for this to work.

2001-07-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * removed possible enforcer hit in YAM_FO.c where the destructor of
      the folder listtree called FO_FreeFolder and tried to remove a Object
      with a InitChange where this Group doesn`t exists anymore.
    * change addressfield completion accordingly to some discussions on the
      mailinglist. if you now press SHIFT+RETURN after entering a string that
      matches a addressbook entry to should not complete it with the realname.
      Also if you send a mail it will not complete already valid email addresses.

2001-07-24  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Centered the checkmark (and label) in the search window.

2001-07-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * change MA_ExamineMail() to only check for uuencoded attachments if the
      header itself doesn`t tell us that this mail in a MULTIPART mail.
      This should speed up the "update index" as well as the download of mail
      a bit.
      Also removed the maximum check of the first 30 lines for a UUE check
      of a mail.
    * added missing status_flags to the Status Group of the read window. Now
      it should show all statuses accordingly to the message status

2001-07-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * removed MUIA_NList_Quiet calls in DisplayMailList YAM_UT.c because
      this will speed up the insertion of items for 3-4 seconds with ~6000
      items. (This is a strange behaviour of the NList class itself)

2001-07-18  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Fixed some wrong RexxMsg types.
    * Enhanced the output of the smake process and also did other minor
      changes to the smakefile (e.g. cleanall now use clean).
    * When DEBUG is enabled NewReadArgs.c includes YAM_debug.h.
    * mail is set to NULL to get rid of that 'uninitialized' warning.
    * Added Classes.c,h to the repository, though these files are
      auto-generated (so they'll go again when I add the auto-generate tool).
    * Re-added Searchwindow.c with uppercase 's' to the repository.
    * Enabled Searchwindow.c in smakefile, since it should compile.
    * The 'search' function of the write window now works. There's only one
      search window (in the global structure) which should probably also be
      used if anyone adds search to the readwindow.

2001-07-17  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * Makefile: renamed revision 1.12 to Makefile.MorphOS 
    * Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS: renamed revison 1.14 to Makefile
    * Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS-ixemul: deleted

2001-07-17  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: (struct Args): fixed GCC cpp problem

    * YAM.c, YAM_addressbookEntry.h, YAM_main.h, YAM_utilities.h, YAM_write.h
      includes/proto/genesis.h: fixed GCC warnings

2001-07-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * replaced "remailer@replay.com" in YAM_CO.c with a uptodate remailer,
      because replay.com no longer provides a remailer service.

2001-06-29  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_hook.h: use proper types in hook casts, change placement of SAVEDS
      in DISPATCHERPROTO to match other uses, added cast for ENTRY argument in
      AmigaOS case

    * YAM_utilities: added OUT_DOS define as replacement for incorrect NULL
      usage
    * YAM_MA.c: (MA_ExecuteRuleAction,MA_StartMacro): use OUT_DOS
    * YAM_TR.c: (TR_ApplyRemoteFilters,TR_NewMailAlert): likewise
    * YAM_UT.c: (ExecuteCommand): likewise

    * YAM_MA.c: (MA_CallRexxFunc) fix wrong NULL usage
    * YAM_TR.c: (TR_IsOnline) likewise
    * YAM_UT.c: (GetBCImage) likewise
    * YAM_rexx.c: (DoRXCommand) likewise

    * YAM_UT.c: (putCharFunc) change parameter type from "char" to "int"

    * YAM_rexx_rxcl.c: changed RESINDEX to utilize stddef.h/offsetof()

    * extrasrc/dice.c: added test for VBCC
    * includes/extra.h: more general access() handling

    * added all_vbcc.c, inlines/*_protos.h and VMakefile

2001-06-25  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Added MyAddHead() function to YAM_UT.c.
    * When reading folder contents messages are now added to the head of the
      list rather than the tail. This makes reading large folder index much
      faster (since AddTail is O(n)), however NList layout is still required,
      so it's still painfully slow...

2001-06-24  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * YAM.c Added proper exitcode and modified Abort()
    * Added classes directory, moved Searchwindow_class to this as
      searchwindow.c, modified smakefile to support this, disabled it
      in smakefile, as it does not yet compile (remove # in CLASSES line
      to enable again)

2001-06-22  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Fixed toolbar init code (uses "tb_butt[i]." instead of const "p->").
    * Added extra toolbar button to write window (search) -- nop ATM.
    * Added new source to the repository (Searchwindow_class.c).

2001-06-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_utilities.h: added "struct NewToolbarEntry"
    * YAM_AB.c (AB_New): merged tb_butt[] and tb_help[] using that struct
    * YAM_MA.c (MA_New): likewise
    * YAM_RE.c (RE_New): likewise
    * YAM_WR.c (Wr_New): likewise

2001-06-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_read.h: (struct RE_GUIData) fixed wrong toolbar array size,
      was off by one since at least YAMos 2.2 ...
    * YAM_utilities.h: added ARRAY_SIZE define
    * YAM_AB.c (AB_New): use it
    * YAM_EA.c (EA_New): likewise

2001-06-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_AB.c,YAM_CL.c,YAM_CO.c,YAM_COg.c,YAM_COs.c,YAM_EA.c,YAM_FI.c,
      YAM_MA.c,YAM_RE.c,YAM_TR.c,YAM_US.c,YAM_UT.c,YAM_WR.c,
      YAM_rexx_rxif.c: added missing "extra.h", fixed double inclusion
      and corrected its usage

2001-06-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * smakefile: added OPTCOMPLEXITY=5 OPTDEPTH=3 to OPTFLAGS,
      created LNKFLAGS
    * makeall.ados: removed MAP file renaming since smakefile already
      creates the "correct" one, fixed scompare statements
    * Makefile, Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS: removed "-c" from $(CDEFS)

    * YAM_WR.c: (MIMewarn,PGPwarn) likewise

2001-06-20  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * fixed smakefile: $< does NOT work, when there are 2 or more depencies
      in the header line! This only works, if the header files are never
      changed and this very unlikely.
    * Also adding $(CDEFS) before RESOPT was not that clever at all.
    * makeall.dos now uses the stuff Gunther introduced

2001-06-20  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * makeall.ados: replaced "move" with "rename"
    * smakefile: changed CFLAGS handling, changed LINK statement
    * Makefile, Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS: restructured
    * starter.c: cleanup

2001-06-20  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

2001-06-20  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: (Initialise) use iconfile as buffer for hideicon,
      move hidecion loading to an appropriate location
      (header) cleanup
    * YAM.c: (Root_New) added const qualifier
      (Initialise) likewise
    * YAM_AB.c: (AB_PrintField) removed format variable

      added const qualifier
      (MA_New) likewise, fixed GCC warning
    * YAM_MAf.c: (MA_MakeFOFormat) added const qualifier
    * YAM_MI.c: (global) added const qualifier

2001-06-19  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * documented disabled warnings in smakefile, remove 2 disabled warnings
    * mada DATA=NEAR in smakefile, suggested by Gunther
    * added YAMOS-texts to other makefiles

2001-06-19  Giles Burdett <layabouts@the-giant-sofa.demon.co.uk>

    * Added #include <extra.h> to a number of files to stop "implicit declaration"
      warnings caused by usage of extra string functions
    * YAM now uses it's own icon when being hidden/iconified, instead of default
      icon provided by MUI

2001-06-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed potential enforcer hits where check for NULL of FO_GetCurrentFolder()
      was missing. Should also fix some enforcer hits on exit of YAM.

2001-06-18  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: (Terminate) always release resources in reverse allocation order
      (main) removed warning about return type and discarded STACKEXT
      (NOTE: STACKEXT doesn't do what was intended! It does *only* extend the
      stack if there is not enough space for the current frame. Thats hardly
      the case for main() ...)
    * YAM_FI.c: fix prototype for FI_IsFastSearch()
    * YAM_global.(c,h): replaced "APTR" with "void *" and removed include
    * YAM_UT.c: (DisplayAppIconStatistics) replaced AppAppIconA() with AddAppIcon()
      (DisplayStatistics) small cleanup

2001-06-18  Giles Burdett <layabouts@the-giant-sofa.demon.co.uk>

    * Added file dependencies listed in smakefile to Makefile, Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS and
      Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS-ixemul.
    * Added GNUC section to YAM_global.c to handle stack stuff - it is an empty section
      because GCC supports neither __stack nor __buffsize, but this empty define should
      really stay so that this fact is recorded instead of leading others to think that
      GCC support has not been considered.

2001-06-17  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * Moved __USE_SYSBASE from YAM_UT.c to smakefile (where it really belongs to).
    * Changed YAM_global.c stack stuff. This needs to be completed.
    * Made some more stuff static.
    * Moved last old.h stuff, old.h got obsolete now. First reordering step
      finished.
    * smakefile reflects the correct dependencies now. Please addapt this for
      other makefiles as well.

2001-06-17  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed "give up after 20 lines" signature strip "feature".
      (Bug #432034)

2001-06-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * the position of a folder was calculated wrong on performed FOLDERINFO rexx
      commands. fixed!
    * if using the folder context menu now, the mail list will be refreshed if
      the user uses the context menu on a folder that is not active. This will
      fix some bugs that will result because the mail list is not in sync with
      the folder list.
    * fixed several bugs concerning syncing of the mail and folder list.
      This also hopefully fixed now really (Bug #433825)

2001-06-16  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * C_c.sd: changed GetStripStr() to work with older versions of flexcat
    * YAM_CO.c: includes "extra.h" to get prototypes for non SAS/C
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed potential enforcer hits dueto FO_GetCurrentFolder() returning NULL
      (NOTE: There are more cases which need fixing!)
    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_WR.c: fixed warnings
    * YAM_WR.c: changed to enable optimizations for SAS/C
    * YAM_global.c: added additional processor checks for GCC and VBCC
    * YAM_rexx_rxcl.c: swapped include order of YAM_#?.h to get rid of warnings
    * extrasrc/dice.c: added popupmenu functions and cleanup
    * includes/extra.h: removed isascii define
    * YAM_WR.c: added isascii define

2001-06-16 Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * No longer sets MUIA_Window_Open to TRUE for main window on uniconify.
      (this had the effect of bringing main window to front on uniconify)
    * Added #define __USE_SYSBASE to YAM_UT.c so that it compiles with SAS/C.
    * Message list no longer has MUIA_NList_DefaultObjectOnClick set to TRUE
      since this makes it non-default when clicking outside the listview.
    * Now sets MUIA_BetterString_KeyUp/DownFocus for the To and Subject
      strings in the mail write window.
    * Updated BetterString_mcc.h (latest Betterstring.mcc can be found in the
      file area of YahooGroups.Com/yamos/).
    * When pressing ',' in the recipient string and text is marked, the comma
      will be inserted at the end of the string. This is to allow easier
      name-completion with multiple recipients.
    * Now sets GUI.NL_MAILS as the default object instead of GUI.LV_MAILS.
    * No longer sets the folder list as active window object when no entries
      exist in the message list (this would e.g. happen after sending emails
      from the outbox, because the outbox goes empty before returning to the
      inbox).
    * The OK gadget in the about window now have some space on each side of
      the label, bares the label 'Okay', is the default object and rendered in
      bold (to indicate the user can use 'return' to continue).
    * The OK gadget is now added after first phase of startup (rather than
      setting MUIA_ShowMe to TRUE) -- mainly because it's now 2 rectangle
      objects and the gadget, so we'd need to set the MUIA_ShowMe value for 3
      objects (not to mention that MUIA_ShowMe is buggy). Also
      MUIA_Window_Activate is set after this initial setup phase, so selecting
      about should now bring up an *active* about window.
    * Cancel is no longer the default gadget in the 'missing subject'-warning
      (since that'd make both the return and escape key act as cancel).

2001-06-16  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Re-added uniconify behaviour when attempting to start a second instance
      of YAM (without enforcer hits).
    * Corrected 'Check version' date.

2001-06-16  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * changed the behaviour of the WarnSubject requester due to some discussions
      in the YAMos ML.

2001-06-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * reactivated information bar, but made it optional. Now a user can select
      if he wants to have the infobar or not.
    * now the ContextMenus for the folder and message list are optional. A user can
      select in the configuration if he wants to have context menus or not.
      (Please note that if a context menu is selected and the user has the mouse
      over the list, the menu shortcuts will not work anymore due to a bug of MUI)
    * made WarnSubject a public option. The user can now select in the config if he
      wants to be warned or not if he is going to send a message without a subject.
    * fixed alignment bug in struct Rule.
    * Flush indices didn`t work on grouped folders - fixed. (Bug #433506)
    * Folder groups will be displayed highlighted&bold now if any child has new or
      unread mail.
    * if popupmenu.library is not present, the contextmenus are disabled completly
      now and it is possible to use the normal menu with shortcuts. Also the config
      items for the ContextMenu are disabled.
    * fixed recently introduced enforcer hits (Bug #433797)

2001-06-15  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed information bar, since it was redundant.

    * Removed error messages when unable to load images.

    * Last year digit was missing in error window - fixed! (Bug #431947)

2001-06-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug that caused that it was not possible to remove a entry from the folder
      listtree. (BUG #431912)
    * reworked addressbook search functions (AB_SearchEntry) completly. Now a search
      in the addressbook should perform faster. This will result in a faster
      name completion in AddressFields and if a mail is going to be sent out
    * fixed some addressbook<->NListtree related bugs/issues.
    * fixed Distribution List bug (BUG #431536)

2001-06-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed alignment Problem in "struct ComprMail" which causes the corruption of
      the old .index files from older 2.x versions. Now we should be compatible again.
    * merge the differences from RELEASE 2.3 branch to actual MAIN branch

2001-06-10  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * moved a lot more stuff to the corresponding header files
    * removed all includes from old.h
    * created YAM_global.h and YAM_global.o
    * made a lot of stuff static to YAM_RE.c, removed obsolete hook
    * changes smakefile to use $(CC) instead of slink

2001-06-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed folder shortcut keys "0-9" to have a fast jump to a folder.
      Folder groups are excluded here and will be overjumped. Also a folded tree will
      be unfolded if the user press a number where the tree was folded.
    * reworked and optimized some code in the addressbook code.
    * fixed addressbook entry selection bug. If a new mail was created and the user
      doubleclicked a entry in the addressbook to get the name in the addressfield
      YAM was not coping this address.
    * changed Library check routine to show the required revision also. Users where
      complaining about the NList.mcc v19.97 -> v19.98 upgrade requirement and the
      error message just showed "required v19".
    * fixed enforcer hit when creating a new folder in the listtree. -bug #431614

2001-06-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed addressbook NListtree bug where status_group image got trashed somehow.
    * now YAM doesn`t require the PROGDIR:Icons/* images anymore. This "feature" was
      added accidently and now it should only print a warning message to the
      Errorwindow of YAM.

2001-06-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * v18.7 of NListtree.mcc is now required because all earlier version seems to be too
      buggy to allow them.
    * The alternative images of the OUTGOING and DELETED folder will now be displayed if
      there is any mail in the folders. This is a more natural behaviour.
    * now the SortFlag of the NList Mail List should work again without flickering the
      Listview.
    * removed "Flush indices" entry of the FolderList ContextMenu

2001-06-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * 'Folder/Check single account' menu is no longer trashed after
      clicking 'Use' in the configuration window. (Bug #425212).

2001-06-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added next version of the folder_xxxx images to CVS
    * included the new folder_xxxx images in the code. Now also alternative images
      for INCOMING/OUTGOING and DELETED show be loaded and if there is new mail in the
      folder the image should change accordingly.
    * added a nice FolderInfoBar above the Listviews. Perhaps we have to make this
      bar optional, but I think it will fit in the layout if we are going to
      introduce TearOff.mcc in YAM.
    * changed FolderInfoBar refreshing. Now it should not flicker anymore and refreshing
      the main NList Mail List should be fast again.

2001-06-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * checked memory allocation&freeing of the folder listtree and it`s mails. Now it
      seems that all works fine.
    * reactivated the CompareHook for the folder listtree. Here we still have to do
      some modifications.

2001-06-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed recently introduced enforcerhit in the parsing of content-disposition
      parts
    * fixed LoadBCImage function where something went wrong with the stcpfn()
      function
    * added folder images from Philip A. Vedovatti to std images.

2001-06-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added support to load standard images for the standard INCOMING/OUTGOING/SENT
      and DELETED folder. The images must have the name "folder_incoming" a.s.o.
      at the PROGDIR:Icons/ directory to get loaded.
    * fixed alternative folder image function. This feature was broken and if you
      placed an image in the folder directory ".fimage" to was loaded incorrect.
      This should work now and if you have such an image file placed in the folder
      directory it will override the standard image that is loaded by YAM.
    * added a separate Error-Requester to screem out that an standard image file
      couldn`t be loaded.
    * added separate "supportfiles/Icons/std" directory at the cvs to place all the
      standard images+icons that should be included in the main YAM archive.

2001-06-01  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * created YAM_debug.h with stuff taken from old.h/YAM.h
    * YAM_FO.c, YAM_MAf.c, YAM_RE.c: use "YAM_debug.h"
    * YAM_UT.c: lame fix for a MUI header problem with GCC
    * YAM_md5.c: removed non-breaking spaces

2001-05-28  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * replaced MD5 calculation by PD variant

2001-05-27  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * moved a lot more stuff to the corresponding header files
    * NOTE: YAM_UT.c should be splitted!
    * Maybe the global variables from YAM.c should move into new file YAM_global.c?

2001-05-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed BUG #407550. Had to insert a InputBuffered at start to assure that G-TR
      gets cleared or otherwise it will be became NULL later which caused that
      mass of hits reported in the BugTracker.
    * a CTRL-C will now break the application and a CTRL-D will restart it immediatly.

2001-05-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added option to define the AppIcon Label that should be displayed. Now a
      User can configurate the string that should be displayed below the AppIcon
      by reconfigurating it in the configuration window (Misc)
    * YAM reads the Content-Disposition: of a multipart message now. If a name of
      a part could not be found in the Content-Type: field we get it from the
      Disposition field now. (i.e. mails with attachments from ELM behave like this)
      [ this fixes the reported bug #285 from Holger J.]
    * fixed today introduced bug. Now the AppIcon Label text gets saved & loaded
      correctly
    * a user can now select all folders that should be included in the AppIcon
      statistics. With that feature displaying statistics is not limited to the
      INCOMING folder anymore.

2001-05-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * variable signatures will now also be used if one want`s to write a NEW or
      FORWARD a mail in a folder which belongs to a mailinglist.
    * the format of the sizes can be choosen now. That means that one can choose
      between different display formats for displaying the message & attachment
      sizes in YAM. I added 4 more different size formats that will hopefully
      fit everyones needs. Default is the standard YAM size format which was there
      since ages.
    * added forgotten Help messages for the SMTP AUTH feature of YAM.
    * fixed bug in the alignment of POP3 struct. The listview of the POP3 accounts
      didn`t show up the accounts anymore. Perhaps here we have to use a separate
      displayhook if this realignment causes trouble with MorphOS.

2001-05-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * converted _WBenchMsg to WBmsg initialised from argv
    * YAM_CO.c: removed PL_IconBody[]
    * YAM_CL.c: added here
    * YAM_UT.c: replaced stch_i() with sscanf()
    * all_gcc.c: removed usage of stch_i

2001-05-22  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Fixed Enforcer Hit when searching by status (Bug #423880)

2001-05-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * put back all fold/unfold statements (///) for our beloved GoldED users :)
      This will break Dirks plan to remove all "//" comments, but I think that`s
      acceptable. ;)

2001-05-20  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * further reorganization
    * made whole code optimizable with SAS-C again (tracking down compiler bugs
      seems to get a hobby of me :-)
    * YAM_FO.c and YAM_EA.c are directly compilable now.

2001-05-20  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * some more stuff. Now at least the files
      YAM_ER.c, YAM_DI.c, YAM_US.c and YAM_md5.c compile without old.h
    * And modifications I do during cleanup:
    * remove clear and bzero, replace them by memset
    * remove stccpy and replace it by MyStrCpy (which is an easy define)
    * changed all "struct Object *" to "Object *"
    * Start using enum types wherever necessary. This will improve error checking.
      All enums get names now and these are used in structures and prototypes.
    * I also started to remove the // comments and replace them by /*** xxx ***/
      or /* xxx */. I hope everyone else will do this also at code-parts he works
      on, so they will disappear very soon.
    * All structure definitions get resorted and most important all elements get
      seperate lines and type entries (Looks much better).
    * Moved all library bases to YAM.c and made them all global. No other
      declarations elsewhere (Maybe we should move these declarations to
      YAM_globals.c as Gunther suggested).

2001-05-19  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * started second step of cleanup
    * replaced compiler.h by SDI_compiler.h (please don't mind Gunther, but it is
      better structured and also reflects you original design better (e.g. ASM))
    * added HOOKPROTO in YAM_hook.h and started to use it everwhere. SDI_compiler.h
      is thus nearly used from YAM_hook.h only (HOOKPROTO taken from freeciv).
    * gen_gates will no longer work, but I think this can be replaced by the
      HOOKPROTO definitions directly.
    * moved wbpath.c into YAM_UT.h
    * the header files are still not complete, but much more :-)
    * compiling with SAS will get faster again, when old.h is away. Maybe also the
      optimizing problem will disappear then?

2001-05-19  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * started first step of real code cleanup (very likely MorphOS support will
      be broken for some time!)
    * gen_includes.pl will be obsoleted by proper structures. If alignment cannot
      be reached by rearranging the stuff, pad bytes maybe added.
    * added lots of header files, added 2 new directories, moved files
    * Later necessary renames (when BETA is rejoined):
      YAM_DI.c --> YAM_glossarydisplay.c
      YAM_WR.c --> YAM_write.c
      YAM_FO.c --> YAM_folderconfig.c
      YAM_MA.c --> YAM_main.c
      YAM_FI.c --> YAM_find.c
      YAM_MI.c --> YAM_mime.c
      YAM_US.c --> YAM_userlist.c
      YAM_AB.c --> YAM_addressbook.c
      YAM_RE.c --> YAM_read.c
      YAM_MAf.c--> YAM_mainFolder.c
      YAM_CO.c --> YAM_config.c
      YAM_TR.c --> YAM_transfer.c
      YAM_COs.c--> YAM_configFile.c
      YAM_COg.c--> YAM_configGUI.c
      YAM_CL.c --> YAM_classes.c
      YAM_UT.c --> YAM_utilities.c
      YAM_ER.c --> YAM_error.c
      YAM_EA.c --> YAM_addressbookEntry.c
    * The old.h files replaces the YAM.h and headers.h and should disappear very
      soon. The includes have to be in the source codes directly and the definitions
      have to be in the related header files.
    * Only really required stuff should be moved there, so we can see obsoleted
      code after this is finished.
    * A BIG SORRY FOR THE PROBLEMS THIS MAY CAUSE, BUT IT WILL BE WORTH THE EFFORT!
    * added supportfiles directory and locale directory, the make process for locales
      should be moved to locale/makefile
    * also still undone, but the makefiles should be joined in major parts!
    * NOTE: The makefiles are to be reworked totally, especially the dependencies

2001-05-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Added separate ContextMenus for the Folder Listtree and the Mail Listview.
      If popupmenu.library v9 or above could be found in the system a right
      mouseclick on the folder listtree or mail listview should pop up a nice
      ContextMenu now.

    * Fixed bug in the AB_FindTodaysBirthdates() function. Now YAM should find
      contacts who have birthday again.

    * Modified & reactivated AB_LB_CmpFunc() again. Now the addressbook should be
      sortable again.

2001-05-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Added hierarchical folder support. Now it is possible to sort the mail folders
      via a listtree and to have folder groups.
      This feature will obsolete the folder SEPARATORs. The .folders config file format
      should stay compatible.

    * It is now possible to display a 16x16 image in front of every folder. The
      image file have to have the name ".fimage" and have to be located in
      the desired folder.
      NOTE: This feature is not finished 100% and has some bug I couldn`t resolve
      yet. -> Help wanted

    * some global optimizations on the folder listtree & mail listview.

2001-05-14  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added two hidden configuration items:
      - AskJumpUnread: if set to 'N', YAM will not suggest to jump to the
        next folder with unread mails.
      - WarnSubject: if set to 'N', YAM will not display the empty
        subject line warning.
      Both defaults to 'Y'.

2001-05-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Fixed Y2K bug in DateStamp2String() function. Now Daterequests to
      UNIXTIME should perform accurate. -> fixes the export email function

    * Removed some unneeded GetLocale calls for getting the TimeZone.
      Getting the actual TimeZone is only needed once YAM is started. This
      changes should also improved the MailListview a little bit because
      The DisplayHook was calling such GetLocale calls everytime.

2001-05-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Reverted back from NFloattext.mcc to Floattext.mcc in about window

    * If you enter an alias in a address field and press return the alias
      or realname will be resolved and the complete e-mail address string
      will be printed in the field now.

    * Added eMail resolving to the address field functions so that also
      while entering a eMail address YAM will try to resolve it from the
      addressbook. The resolve & expand ording will be
      Alias->RealName->eMail.

    * Fixed mailing list stuff again. Now Shift/Alt-Reply should behave
      like before.

2001-05-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Did some cosmetic changes to the About window

    * Modified Copyright string in About window and also in every source
      file

    * NListview & NList.mcc will be used now in the Attachment part of
      the write window

    * Added Title to the window that lists each part of a message.

    * Fixed behaviour of Mailing List feature for every folder. Now the
      correct From/To etc. should be set if To: Pattern is used

    * Added Signature selection to Mailinglist feature. Now you can select
      a different signature for every mailing list.

2001-05-06  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Added backwards search to the 'change to next folder with unread
      mail' feature.

    * MA_ChangeFolder() now jumps to the first unread mail from bottom
      if reverse sorting is used in one of the sort criteria.
      This is needed for the above feature.

2001-05-01  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed enforcer hits when trying to spawn a second instance of YAM
      while the first one is starting up.

2001-04-30  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed a nasty crash bug when loading corrupted indices.  Left some
      debug info in there, since I lost the corrupted index during the
      tests.

2001-04-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * removed obsolete MCC NListtree check in addressbook code

2001-04-26  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added correct MCC version check.
    * Library open errors will now always be displayed in a requester,
      no matter if MUI is available. If possible, localized.

2001-04-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * replaced Listtree.mcc with NListtree.mcc of Carsten Scholling
    * fixed some minor bugs in the addressbook code
    * added CVS $id tags to every source file for better revision control
    * changed AppIcon to also show the unread messages of the INCOMING
      folder (this is a feature I was searching for a long time :)
    * did some small cosmetic changes to the code


2001-04-07  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Nicer compilation date in About window ("7.4.2001" -> "07-Apr-01").

2001-04-02  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Using Locale timezone setting now if available.

2001-03-21  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Offers to save the address book on quit if it was modified

    * Added some return statements to avoid warnings

2001-03-20  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Fixed enforcer hits when listing a PGP keyring with very long UID
      lines.

2001-03-19  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * When the maileditor is invoked from a readwindow this is updated
      after editing.

2001-03-17  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Added rather rudimentary LaTeX printing support

2001-03-13  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Added a warning when a mail without subject is going to be sent.

2001-03-10  Jörg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Changes for GCC/ixemul.

    * Workaround for the 'crash on editwindow close' bug added
      (YAM_UT.c/DisposeModule()).

2001-03-10  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Changed dynamic string functions in YAM_UT.c to use calloc()/free()
      instead of AllocMem()/FreeMem() and thus (hopefully) memory pools.

2001-03-08  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Fixed: potential NULL pointer referenced in StrBufCat() and
      StrBufCpy()

    * Started to improve the printing system (see RE_PrintFile())

2001-03-07  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Fixed: CheckPrinter() assumed printer on parallel port when
      interpreting printer.device status bits

2001-03-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Changed compiler options to avoid linker warning.

    * Changed default CPU target in SAS/C makefile to 68020.

2001-02-19  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * When pressing "shift right" in the read window YAM now looks
      if there are unread mails in folders after the current one
      (below the current one in the folders list).
      If there are such folders the user is asked if he wants to change
      to the first of these and continue reading there.

2001-02-19  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed memory deallocation of all mails on shutdown when
      compiling with SAS/C - based on the assumption that SAS/C uses
      memory pools in its malloc()/free() implementation.

2001-02-17  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added TYPE/N (internal format) to the STEM that ARexx command
      FOLDERINFO returns:
      0 = normal
      1 = incoming
      2 = outgoing
      3 = sent (built-in)
      4 = deleted
      5 = sent and received
      6 = sent
      Useful for ARexx scripts when deciding whether to show the "From:"
      or "To:" header line.

    * Fixed wbstart-crash, which was introduced with the removal of
      the library auto-open (on January 28th).

2001-02-15 msbethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Added external quote function to edit window (+preferences)

2001-02-14  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Address Book/New/Portrait/Select: The ASL requester title was
      "Se_lect" (same string used twice) - fixed! (Bug #131008).

2001-02-04  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed broken ARexx interface for SAS/C (introduced on January
      28th).

2001-02-04  Jörg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Fixed Utility and LocalBase types, added m68k-AmigaOS makefile
      and some other minor changes to be able to compile with GCC again.
      SAS/C users with old, broken includes have to fix them now.

2001-02-01  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed enforcer hits when encountering message headers with
      non-terminated MIME-encoded text (i.e. during a folder rescan).

2001-01-29  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added dynamic date string creation in smakefile.

2001-01-28  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@amigaworld.com>

    * Moved SAS-C make process completely into smakefile

    * Now uses original Listtree includes

2000-12-21  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed a very nasty bug when using the ARexx command MAILWRITE with
      the QUIET switch.

    * YAM would try to send mails using SMTP AUTH when a username was
      configured, even though "Use SMTP AUTH" wasn't selected. Fixed.
      Localized ESMTP error message.

2000-12-20  Jörg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Added SMTP AUTH to config GUI.

2000-12-20  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Finished slave work on menus in main window.

    * Added "Fixed font" menu item in read window to quickly switch
      font when needed. It doesn't work yet, though, since TextEditor.mcc
      doesn't seem to catch MUIA_TextEditor_FixedFont on the fly.

    * Now explicitly opens utility.library.

2000-12-19  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed .taglines bug - %'s was used for formatting, which would
      result in a "***NULL POINTER***" mess.

    * Localized all menu shortcuts in main window.

2000-12-18  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Using ARexx commands MAILWRITE and MAILSEND, while YAM is iconified
      and the external editor is configured to be spawned always, would
      throw enforcer hits. Fixed.

    * Got rid of the ANSI C time() function, which would access ENV:TZ
      each time a log entry or new mail was to be written.

2000-12-17  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * SAS/C fixes. Now compiles again, also without V44 includes.

    * Removed enforcer hits when creating new messages.

    * YAM.cd: Set max. length of commodity description to 39 characters.

    * Added sprintf() replacement with Locale support.

2000-12-10  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed custom bsdsocket.library interface - now uses the includes.

2000-12-07  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added "Reply-To:" address to folder options. Useful for folders that
      are mail aliases instead of real mailing lists, to avoid getting
      dublicate answers.

2000-12-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Enforcer hits when doing: rx "address 'YAM';info"
      (without arguments) Fixed!

    * Added "From:" address to folder options. Useful when using
      different e-mail addresses on different mailing lists.

    * When deleting a bunch of mails, and one with Disposition
      Notification pops up - new option: Ignore all

2000-11-22  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Added partial PGP multipart support

                          AmiSSL Library - 4.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is version 4.2 of the AmiSSL library for Amiga based operating systems
and the first public open-source based release of AmiSSL. Version 4.x is a new
major release which comes with full compatibility to the OpenSSL 1.1.x line
which includes important security related fixes and comes with new encryption
ciphers which are required nowadays to connect to modern SSL-based services
(e.g.  HTTPS). However, due to fundamental changes in the API between the old
AmiSSLv3 and new v4 versions and the large changes between the old OpenSSL
0.9.x and the new OpenSSL 1.1.x line applications have to be recompiled with
the updated AmiSSL SDK to take full advantage of the modernized OpenSSL 1.1.x
API. Besides that fundamental change, AmiSSLv4 can be installed on top of a
AmiSSLv3 installation while still ensuring that applications compiled for
AmiSSLv3 will continue to work properly.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
This release comes with binaries for the AmigaOS4/PPC and AmigaOS3/m68k
platform only.  Unfortunately, due to lack of motivated developers we couldn't
provide native binaries for the MorphOS/PPC or AROS (PPC, i386, x86_64)
platform in time. If you are, however, interested in seeing AmiSSL v4 being
ported for these other Amiga-based platforms, please try to find motivated and
talented developers who could join our team as proper maintainers for these
alternative platforms. In addition, if you are a MorphOS or AROS developer
yourself, feel free to send proper pull requests to see your platform
supported in one of the next releases or please consider joining our team.

Requirements:
------------
- AmigaOS 4.0+/PPC, AmigaOS 3.0+/68020+ or MorphOS

Version 4.2 (07.03.2018):
------------------------
- Updated OpenSSL backend to full compatibility to latest
  OpenSSL 1.1.0g (02.11.2017) version.
- Updated root certificates to latest Mozilla-based bundle provided
  by https://curl.haxx.se/ca/
- Fixed https.c example cleanup code for non-OS4 targets (#18)
- Reinstated AmigaOS multithreading support and semaphore protection, using
  the new thread API introduced in OpenSSL 1.1.0 (#17)
- Include `ppcinline/macros.h` which contains all `LPXX()` macros to use the
  AmiSSL includes for MorphOS.
- Minor improvements/fixes.

                          AmiSSL Library - 5.20
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

AmiSSL is a port of OpenSSL in a shared library for Amiga-based systems.
OpenSSL (www.openssl.org) is "an open source project that provides a
robust, commercial-grade, and full-featured toolkit for the Transport
Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols. It is also
a general-purpose cryptography library."

Many mail servers now rely on SSL/TLS and the version that is advertised
here is an important security update and every YAM user is advised to
install this new version.

For more information about the detail of changes in this version please
consult the ChangeLog file within the AmiSSL lha archive.

                         codesets.library - 6.16
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

codesets.library is a generic codesets conversion library commonly used
for converting characters from one codeset to another. It also provides
UTF8 support to YAM and allows to read UTF8 mails by converting the mail
text into the local charset configured.

The version that is advertised here is an important bugfixing update and
every YAM user is adviced to use this new version instead of the original
version supplied with the original YAM distribution.

For more information about the detail of changes in this version please
consult the ChangeLog file within the lha archive of codesets.library.

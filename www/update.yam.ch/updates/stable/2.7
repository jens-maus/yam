CHANGES:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           YAM - Version 2.7
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

About YAM
---------
YAM (Yet Another Mailer) lets you send and receive electronic mail (e-mail)
over the Internet and maintain archives  of messages in your computer via a
graphical  user interface.  The idea  came to  the original  author (Marcel
Beck)  back in  1995  when  he first  tried  using  e-mail. The  programmes
available at the time were either powerful but complicated to configure, or
else  used a  too  limiting user  interface. The  goal,  therefore, was  to
program a  cross between AdMail and  AirMail, with a few  ideas coming from
Pegasus Mail.

While  earlier  versions  of  YAM were  developed  closed  source,  today's
versions are developed  by an independent open source  community. Since the
year 2000 a group of mixed developers maintain YAM and release new versions
from time  to time.  While these  versions are all  targeted for  the Amiga
platform,  versions of  different AmigaOS  incarnations are  supplied. This
includes native  PowerPC ports to  modern Amiga platforms like  AmigaOS4 or
MorphOS.


Before you start the installation
---------------------------------
YAM 2.5+ not only uses newer  configuration files, the files  used to store
separate emails are named differently  as well. Therefore, before you start
the  installation  script to  overwrite  your  existing installation,  it's
strongly recommended that you create a backup of your old YAM installation,
including all folders  and configuration files. Afterwards  you can install
the update into your old YAM directory  if you wish. On  start-up, YAM 2.5+
will automatically convert  your old  configuration files  to the  new 2.5+
format,  and after  being  started,  YAM will  rename  your  old emails  as
necessary,  always under  your control.  It  is also  recommended that  you
re-save your  configuration as  soon as  possible in  order to  update your
.config  file to  the new  format, which  will reveal  all the  new options
available.

In addition,  please note  that since  YAM 2.5 no  YAM: assign  is required
anymore. That means, you may even install it in a new location and start it
right  away from  there  without  having to  touch  your old  installation.
Afterwards you  may manually import  the mails from your  old installation.


What's new
----------
Here's a  list (in  alphabetical order)  of the  brave developers  who have
contributed   to    this   release    since   the   last    official   one:

              Frank Weber
              Jens Langner
              Thore Boeckelmann

And here's a  PARTIAL list of the  changes in this version  with respect to
the previous official update:

- updated translations for czech, french, german, greek, italian, swedish
  and spanish language.
- updated amigaguide documentation for spanish.
- general performance improvements and general bug fixing.
- when text in a read window is selected and the user presses "reply",
  the reply will only contain the selected text rather than all.
- the column width of the preselection window can now be saved with
  MUI's own snapshot functionality.
- closing YAM while a write window is open is possible now. However, a
  confirmation requester is now presented to the user.
- YAM will now recognize incompatible mail file formats when importing.
- added a direct menu item to the amiga guide documentation of YAM.
- completely removed the anonymous mailing feature as there aren't any
  anon remailer services anymore that are not abused for junk mail.
- changed YAM to have the SPAM folder available by default. Everyone should
  use a SPAM filter nowadays.
- the online check feature in YAM can now accept multiple interfaces by
  using a comma separated list of interface names.
- implemented an additional ARexx command to let YAM restart itself.
- the crop attachment requester can now be suppressed by a hidden config
  option.
- statistics on new/unread mails will now also be shown for folder groups.
- When using the "Check for Update" menu item YAM will now directly respond
  instead of always keeping itself silent.
- a potential "mailto:" in front of an email address will now be automatically
  stripped.
- the way mails are forwarded (either inlined or as attachment) can now be
  chosen from the various menus in YAM.
- implemented option to suppress the final mail filter requester.
- implemented possibility to automatically run a script before and after
  YAM starts or is finished with mail filtering operations.
- multiple files can now be selected when try to import mails.
- the preselection window functionality can now be set for each account
  separately.
- changed the remote filter to be applicable on a per-POP3 account basis.
- when moving a mail graphically from one folder to another and that folder
  is within a closed node, the listtree will now automatically open that node.
- completly reworked the functionaliyt which converts html mails to plain text.
  Now soft styles (bold/italic, etc.) are shown and the conversion should show
  much prettier results.
- in case a folder is renamed mail filters will be automatically adapt to that
  change.
- changed all folder list displays to show a hierarchical listtree rather than
  a plain list. This should make the whole folder display more intuitive.
- reworked/fixed the recipientstring in the write window to be somewhat more
  intuitive in showing actual found hits.
- to save memory indexes of custom folders will now be automatically expunged
  in case they haven't been access for certain minutes.
- changed birthday reminder to be non-blocking and to be able to snapshot the
  position and size of it. Furthermore, YAM will now rememeber if the reminder
  was already shown and don't popup the same requester again at the same day
  if it is restarted.
- significantly improved performance of string searches (to search for mails)
  by implementation of Boyer/Moore Search algorithms.
- finally YAMs' internals are fully multithreaded. That means many things
  within YAM are now changed to work without blocking the GUI interface.
  This includes the TCP/IP routines which are now running in separate
  threads/processes rather than blocking the main GUI during a mail transfer.
  Furthermore, this was a mandatory thing for being able to implement
  IMAP support in the somewhat near future.
- lots of other improvement we don't remember right now (keep in mind:
  more than 2 years of development was put into YAM 2.7!) :)

If  you want  to have  a more  detailed technical  information on  what was
actually  changed, please  have a  look at  the included  'ChangeLog' file.

What is still missing?
----------------------
- lots of translators! YAM 2.4 featured lots of different languages, but
  due to the large amount of changed texts these catalogs are completely
  outdated. Especially support for such common languages as Danish,
  Finnish, etc. is currently missing. If you are a native speaker
  of a language that YAM does not offer (anymore), then please contact us.
- lots of documentation! As with the translation, the documentation largely
  lags behind. Again, if you are a native speaker (even for English) and if
  you are interested in updating/writing YAM's documentation then please
  contact us.
- now that YAM 2.5+ comes with a new themes management, users are free to
  create own themes in a fashion that allow them to exchange them with
  other users. So go and create your own themes and submit them via
  AmiNET&Co! :)

Source code
-----------
Due to lack of time and motivation, Marcel Beck stopped working on YAM back
in 2000, but the sources were released under the GNU General Public License
at SourceForge.net. If you want to  help developing this program further or
perhaps you are considering a port  to a different operating system, please
consider joining the YAM Open Source team  instead of doing it on your own.
Our  home page  is  at http://yam.ch/  from which  you  can obtain  all
necessary  information   to  contact  us.   We  want  to  hear   from  you!

Donations
---------
If you  like the development of  YAM and you  want to give our  open source
developers an additional motivation to continue  to update YAM in future or
if you simply want to say "Thanks", the YAM project accepts money donations
via PayPal.  All the  donations during  a release  cycle are  collected and
divided by considering  the activity of each developer during  the time the
development lasted. This way we hope  to attract more developers in future,
which   in   turn  should   give   you   a   new  version   more   quickly.

So in  case you  want to support  our efforts to  develop a  modern up2date
e-mail client  for modern AmigaOS-based  systems, please consult  the above

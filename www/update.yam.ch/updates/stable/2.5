CHANGES:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     YAM - Final Stable 2.5 Version
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The YAM (Yet Another Mailer) open source development team is pleased to 
announce the immediate release of its stable 2.5 version. After nearly 5 
years of constant, restless development, the 2.5 version is the currently 
most stable and most advanced version of the famous Amiga e-mail suite. 
 
The 2.5 version, apart from very important bug fixes, comes with a largely 
enhanced user interface with new capabilities like, e.g. an embedded read 
pane functionality to directly read e-mails without having to open separate 
read windows. Or even a new search bar allows to quickly search for e-mails 
or sort them according to predefined categories. Furthermore, YAM was 
largely reworked internally to perform not only more securely and less 
cumbersomely. It also comes with important technical enhancements like 
non-blocking I/O based socket connections allowing the GUI to become more 
responsive or improved compatibility to common internet standards (RFC). In 
addition, large internal reworks were performed to be able to implement 
features like IMAP support or native HTML mail display in one of the next 
versions. 
 
Therefore, we are indeed very happy to supply you this stable 2.5 release 
not only right before Christmas, but also right before we are going to 
start on working on some more interesting things in the upcoming year. 
 
Enjoy the 2.5 version and happy yamming... 
Your YAM Open Source Team

Before you start the installation
---------------------------------
YAM 2.5  not only uses newer  configuration files, the files  used to store
separate emails are named differently  as well. Therefore, before you start
the  installation  script to  overwrite  your  existing installation,  it's
strongly recommended that you create a backup of your old YAM installation,
including all folders  and configuration files. Afterwards  you can install
the update into  your old YAM directory  if you wish. On  start-up, YAM 2.5
will  automatically convert  your old  configuration files  to the  new 2.5
format,  and after  being  started,  YAM will  rename  your  old emails  as
necessary,  always under  your control.  It  is also  recommended that  you
re-save your  configuration as  soon as  possible in  order to  update your
.config  file to  the new  format, which  will reveal  all the  new options
available.

In addition,  please note  that since  YAM 2.5 no  YAM: assign  is required
anymore. That means, you may even install it in a new location and start it
right  away from  there  without  having to  touch  your old  installation.
Afterwards you  may manually import  the mails from your  old installation.

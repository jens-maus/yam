                          YAM - Version 2.9
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

About YAM
---------
YAM (Yet Another Mailer) lets you send and receive electronic mail (e-mail)
over the Internet and maintain archives  of messages in your computer via a
graphical  user interface.  The idea  came to  the original  author (Marcel
Beck)  back in  1995  when  he first  tried  using  e-mail. The  programmes
available at the time were either powerful but complicated to configure, or
else  used a  too  limiting user  interface. The  goal,  therefore, was  to
program a  cross between AdMail and  AirMail, with a few  ideas coming from
Pegasus Mail.

While  earlier  versions  of  YAM were  developed  closed  source,  today's
versions are developed  by an independent open source  community. Since the
year 2000 a group of mixed developers maintain YAM and release new versions
from time  to time.  While these  versions are all  targeted for  the Amiga
platform,  versions of  different AmigaOS  incarnations are  supplied. This
includes native  PowerPC ports to  modern Amiga platforms like  AmigaOS4 or
MorphOS.


Before you start the installation
---------------------------------
YAM 2.5+ not only uses newer  configuration files, the files  used to store
separate emails are named differently  as well. Therefore, before you start
the  installation  script to  overwrite  your  existing installation,  it's
strongly recommended that you create a backup of your old YAM installation,
including all folders  and configuration files. Afterwards  you can install
the update into your old YAM directory  if you wish. On  start-up, YAM 2.5+
will automatically convert  your old  configuration files  to the  new 2.5+
format,  and after  being  started,  YAM will  rename  your  old emails  as
necessary,  always under  your control.  It  is also  recommended that  you
re-save your  configuration as  soon as  possible in  order to  update your
.config  file to  the new  format, which  will reveal  all the  new options
available.

In addition,  please note  that since  YAM 2.5 no 'YAM:' assign is required
anymore. That means, you may even install it in a new location and start it
right  away from  there  without  having to  touch  your old  installation.
Afterwards you  may manually import  the mails from your  old installation.
Thus, you can in principle now have to independent installation of YAM
using two completly different versions.


What's new
----------
Here's a  list (in  alphabetical order)  of the  brave developers  who have
contributed   to    this   release    since   the   last    official   one:

              Jens Maus
              Thore BÃ¶ckelmann

And here's a  PARTIAL list of the  changes in this version  with respect to
the previous official update:

- implemented proper UTF-8 support for the whole index of a folder. This
  allows now to switch charsets without having to rescan a folder index.
- implemented a completely new procedure to deal with timezone and daylight
  saving times as the old method were unable to identify the daylight
  saving time for past dates. Now the official timezone databases published
  by iana.org are used instead. This finally corrects the time display for
  old mails when DST times changes relative to the current date/time.
- The main window layout (size+position) and list sorting options will now
  be automatically saved upon exiting YAM rather than forcing a user to
  explicitly 'snapshot' that information via the corresponding MUI
  functionality. An additional option in the configuration of YAM allow to
  disable this, thought.
- Enforce disposing of all images if YAM is running on an 8 bit screen
  (excluding the Workbench) as soon as the image is no longer used. This
  works around a bug in picture.datatype which seems to keep a pointer to
  the screen the image was remapped to and accesses it later even if the
  screen no longer exists.
- fixed the partly broken support for the Mail-Reply-To (MRT) and
  Mail-Followup-To (MFT) headers where YAM was not suggesting the right
  reply addresses according to the documentation of the MRT/MFT feature.
- improved charset/codeset handling support when using external editors
  aware of UTF-8
- fixed a problem where YAM was unable to create properly UTF-8 encoded
  emails.
- when adding new filters YAM will now automatically jump to the bottom of
  the filter rule list.
- To cleanup the main program directory of YAM all folder directories will
  be automatically moved to a new subdirectory named "Folders" in the
  user's mail directory (which defaults to YAM's program directory if not
  changed via ToolTypes or the user configuration). Possibly duplicate
  directory names get a unique number appended. To ease folder setup it is
  not possible anymore to select any arbitrary path for a folder, but only
  the directory name within the "Folders" directory.
- The write window now features a small clone of the attachment list on the
  first page. A context menu allows to perform the same actions as for the
  big list on the second page.
- Implemented an interactive attachment reminder feature as known from
  Thunderbird. If enabled and the user types in certain keywords from a
  user definable list and no attachment has been added to the mail a
  reminder will be shown to inform the user that an attachment might be
  desired.
- Implemented an 'Archive' folder which move mails to a folder named after
  the mail's original send date. The archive folders are excluded from
  deleting old mails automatically to make sure the mails are really
  archived until the user explicitly deletes them.
- implemented a new functionality to allow to define different 'incoming'
  and 'sent' folders per configured mail account (POP3/SMTP). This should
  allow to more easily and directly filter emails not requiring to
  explicitly define separate filters.
- Fixed a bug which caused YAM to use the first matching address of a mail
  as user identity even if this address was the sending instead of the
  receiving one.
- fixed a bug where the MAILINFO ARexx command caused a crash if the mail
  in question contained no message ID.
- when opening a new window YAM will now set the title of a screen to the
  same title as well. This improves recognition of the currently active
  window as the screen titlebar will then automatically refer to YAM and
  thus make it possible that a user identifies by looking at the screen
  title bar which application is the currently active one.
- fixed a buffer overrun in the RFC 2014 decoding routines which
  potentially caused unexpected crashes.
- restored the behavior of previous versions when resolving the names of
  address book mailing lists. The new method added in YAM 2.8+ caused
  certain problems.
- fixed the read/unread marking of mails which was not done for all columns
  of the mail list.
- when checking for new mails YAM will now show "Checking mails from ..."
  rather than "Mail Transfer from ..." which was not entirely correct.
- The position of the quick search bar is now configurable and allows the
  user to place the bar below the main mail list.
- improved online documentation (http://doc.yam.ch/) regarding the use of
  quotes when specifying file/directory paths.
- changed the "jumping to the first unread and/or most recent message when
  entering a folder" functionality to be configurable on a per folder basis
  instead of a being a global option only.
- The time and date information from the Date: header line will now be
  converted to local time if the usual "short" headers are shown. For full
  header display it will be shown as it is.
- The entered search string is now automatically cloned between the
  different pages.
- The output of the external archiver command can now be redirected
  optionally to a console window while the archiver is running to show the
  progress.
- The single items of the list can now be activated immediately by pressing
  their number on the keyboard. "0" will be mapped to the 10th attachment.
- All kinds of links (http(s), ftp, etc) will now be underlined as well.
- deleting or archiving a single mail will now behave consistently in every
  situation and correctly respect the folder's current sort order.
- any rule of a configured filter can now be removed or an additional one
  added in between instead of allowing only to add/delete rules to/from the
  bottom of the rule list.
- The mail preselection list now shows the contents of the To: header line
  to let users spot unwanted mails easier.
- Printing a mail will now include a list of attachments. Additionally the
  printout will no longer contain a plain copy of all header lines, but a
  stripped down version of subject sender, receiver and date.
- implemented a NOICONS switch for the REQUESTFILE Arexx command which will
  open the corresponding file requester but hide and icons (#?.info files).
- The Get and Send toolbar buttons will now be disabled in case there is no
  active POP3 or SMTP server available.
- fixed a problem with not seeing a folder added to the folder list
  immediately.
- address book entries can now be sorted by clicking on the list titles
  similar to the mail list of the main window.
- fixed the LISTFREEZE and LISTUNFREEZE arexx commands to deal correctly
  with the Quiet settings of other YAM components.
- PGP encrypted mails can now be excluded from a search to let in run
  unattended without the need to enter a password.
- Mails dragged out of the spam folder will now be marked as non-spam in
  case the "mark on move" option is enabled.
- implemented a new "Mail Account" column in the main mail list to be able
  to sort emails based on mail account/hostname a mail was received so that
  users can better order their mails due to the fact that since YAM 2.8
  mails are now transferred asynchronously from multiple servers.
- Searching user identities by address or ID will now correctly respect the
  identity's active state and return active identities only. In case a mail
  references an inactive user identity YAM will silently fall back to the
  next best matching identity.
- Implemented a new option to trigger a snapshot action on all alive
  windows and to save the layout/state of certain groups and objects.
- fixed a bug so that any edit operation in the quick search bar will now
  abort a search operation in progress.
- fixed a problem when YAM was run for the very first time after an
  installation without any valid .config file. Opening the config window
  too early caused this window to be opened without any graphics from the
  default theme.
- when changing a folder's path the global .folders file will be
  immediately saved to make the change persistent.
- mails from the Trash folder are now excluded from the spam filter.
- mail disposal is now protected by a reference counter. This makes it
  possible to move a mail to a different folder in concurrent processes
  while still accessing the same mail without accessing invalid or already
  freed memory. This fixes numerous different potential crash problems.
- All SPAM filter related GUI elements will now be properly disabled if the
  SPAM filter is completely disabled as well.
- fixed a crash bug when using the gravatar image search functionality on a
  never set address book entry.
- the online ARexx documentation (http://doc.yam.ch/) can now be directly
  accessed via the corresponding main menu item.
- fixed a problem where html parts of a mail weren't forwarded to a web
  browser but saved to disk instead due to not using the right file
  extension.
- added a fresh and updated finnish translation/catalog to YAM.
- added a low memory handler to flush all folder indexes automatically if a
  system is about to run low on memory.
- fixed a crash bug when in the write window the autosave functionality
  activates while typing.
- when enabling the "detect cyrillic code sets" functionality YAM will now
  warn the user in case he has setup YAM to use a non-cyrillic code set for
  as the local charset.
- significantly improved performance of parsing emails with large
  attachments. Now YAM will reuse the size parameter of each MIME part to
  speed up memory allocations during MIME parsing.
- fixed a problem where editing a mail a second time added an additional
  superfluous white space to the mail body.

If  you want  to have  a more  detailed technical  information on  what was
actually  changed, please  have a  look at  the included  'ChangeLog' file.
You can also consult the official YAM homepage for more information on the
changes done with YAM 2.9 (http://yam.ch/milestone/YAM%202.9)

What is still missing?
----------------------
- lots of translators! YAM 2.4 featured lots of different languages, but
  due to the large amount of changed texts these catalogs are completely
  outdated. Especially support for such common languages as Danish,
  Finnish, etc. is currently missing. If you are a native speaker
  of a language that YAM does not offer (anymore), then please contact us.
  See http://yam.ch/wiki/Localization for more information.
- lots of documentation! As with the translation, the documentation largely
  lags behind. Again, if you are a native speaker (even for English) and if
  you are interested in updating/writing YAM's documentation then please
  contact us. Now that with YAM 2.8+ we have switch to a pure online-based
  documentation system people are welcome updating the online documentation
  which can be found at http://docs.yam.ch/ and is based on a public wiki
  engine.

in 2000, but the sources were released under the GNU General Public License
at SourceForge.net. If you want to  help developing this program further or
perhaps you are considering a port  to a different operating system, please
consider joining the YAM Open Source team  instead of doing it on your own.

necessary  information   to  contact  us.   We  want  to  hear   from  you!

Donations
---------
If you  like the development of  YAM and you  want to give our  open source
developers an additional motivation to continue  to update YAM in future or
if you simply want to say "Thanks", the YAM project accepts money donations
via PayPal.  All the  donations during  a release  cycle are  collected and
divided by considering  the activity of each developer during  the time the
development lasted. This way we hope  to attract more developers in future,
which   in   turn  should   give   you   a   new  version   more   quickly.

CHANGES:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     YAM - Final Stable 2.6 Version
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The YAM (Yet Another Mailer) open source development team is pleased to 
announce the immediate release of its stable 2.6 version. After two
years of constant, restless development, the 2.6 version is the currently 
most stable and most advanced version of the famous Amiga e-mail suite. 
 
Before you start the installation
---------------------------------
In case you have still YAM 2.4 or a previous version running and you want
to upgrade to 2.6 you have to note that YAM 2.5+ not only uses newer 
configuration files, the files  used to store separate emails are named
differently  as well. Therefore, before you start the  installation  script
to  overwrite  your  existing installation,  it's strongly recommended that
you create a backup of your old YAM installation, including all folders  and 
configuration files. Afterwards  you can install the update into your old
YAM directory  if you wish. On  start-up, YAM 2.5+ will automatically
convert  your old  configuration files  to the  new 2.5+ format,  and after
being  started,  YAM will  rename  your  old emails  as necessary,  always
under  your control.  It  is also  recommended that  you re-save your
configuration as  soon as  possible in  order to  update your .config  file 
to  the new  format, which  will reveal  all the  new options available.

In addition,  please note  that since  YAM 2.5 no  YAM: assign  is required
anymore. That means, you may even install it in a new location and start it
right  away from  there  without  having to  touch  your old  installation.
Afterwards you  may manually import  the mails from your  old installation.

What's new
----------
Here's a  list (in  alphabetical order)  of the  brave developers  who have
contributed   to    this   release    since   the   last    official   one:

              Alexey Ivanov
              David Rey
              Guenther Nikl
              Jens Langner
              Joerg Strohmayer
              Matthias Rustler
              Olaf Barthel
              Thore Boeckelmann

And here's a  PARTIAL list of the  changes in this version  with respect to
the previous official update:

- updated translations for czech, french, german, greek, italian and swedish
  language.
- updated default theme images by Martin 'Mason' Merz.
- added import and export functions for alien address books (i.e. XML files
  as used by SimpleMail).
- AmigaOS4.1's new notification system will can used to inform the user about
  new received mails.
- improved handling of header lines in general and especially malformed header
  lines by certain Microsoft software.
- improved download and export speed of mails by optimizing the amount of data
  shown on the screen. Overall the speed increased about 200%.
- improved the spam handling by treating the user's address book as a white
  list.
- rewritten RFC2047 and RFC2822 routines to match the current RFC
  recommendations.
- individual character sets can now be configured for reading and writing mails
  instead of having one character set for all actions.
- improved ARexx command handling and extended command set.
- all error messages which occured during a mail transfer now include the
  account name to make it easier to spot the faulty account in case a user has
  more than one account at the same provider.
- mail attachments are displayed as a scrollable virtual group to be able to
  show an unlimited number of files.
- all balance object use the new NBalance.mcc class which supports custom
  mouse pointers.
- foreign characters with a mail may be converted to either "?" or similar look
  alike characters.
- reduced overall stack usage by using dynamically allocated memory when needed.
- the text font and style can be configured independently for reading and
  writing mails .
- the spam training data can be optimized to keep the data base small by removing
  very rarely used word.
- made the date scanning of birthdays locale aware.
- added various AROS versions (i386, ppc, x86_64).
- added NOSPLASHWINDOW tooltype to start/quit YAM silently.
- on AmigaOS4.1 the new URL: device will be preferred over openurl.library to
  invoke a browser.
- lots of other improvement we don't remember right now (keep in mind:
  more than 2 years of development was put into YAM 2.6!) :)

If  you want  to have  a more  detailed technical  information on  what was
actually  changed, please  have a  look at  the included  'ChangeLog' file.

What is still missing?
----------------------
- lots of translators! YAM 2.4 featured lots of different languages, but
  due to the large amount of changed texts these catalogs are completely
  outdated. Especially support for such common languages as Danish,
  Finnish, Spanish, etc. is currently missing. If you are a native speaker
  of a language that YAM does not offer (anymore), then please contact us.
- lots of documentation! As with the translation, the documentation largely
  lags behind. Again, if you are a native speaker (even for English) and if
  you are interested in updating/writing YAM's documentation then please
  contact us.
- now that YAM 2.5+ comes with a new themes management, users are free to
  create own themes in a fashion that allow them to exchange them with
  other users. So go and create your own themes and submit them via
  AmiNET&Co! :)

Donations
---------
If you  like the development of  YAM and you  want to give our  open source
developers an additional motivation to continue  to update YAM in future or
if you simply want to say "Thanks", the YAM project accepts money donations
via PayPal.  All the  donations during  a release  cycle are  collected and
divided by considering  the activity of each developer during  the time the
development lasted. This way we hope  to attract more developers in future,
which   in   turn  should   give   you   a   new  version   more   quickly.

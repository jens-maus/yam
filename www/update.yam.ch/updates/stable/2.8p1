---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          YAM - Version 2.8p1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

About YAM
---------
YAM (Yet Another Mailer) lets you send and receive electronic mail (e-mail)
over the Internet and maintain archives  of messages in your computer via a
graphical  user interface.  The idea  came to  the original  author (Marcel
Beck)  back in  1995  when  he first  tried  using  e-mail. The  programmes
available at the time were either powerful but complicated to configure, or
else  used a  too  limiting user  interface. The  goal,  therefore, was  to
program a  cross between AdMail and  AirMail, with a few  ideas coming from
Pegasus Mail.

While  earlier  versions  of  YAM were  developed  closed  source,  today's
versions are developed  by an independent open source  community. Since the
year 2000 a group of mixed developers maintain YAM and release new versions
from time  to time.  While these  versions are all  targeted for  the Amiga
platform,  versions of  different AmigaOS  incarnations are  supplied. This
includes native  PowerPC ports to  modern Amiga platforms like  AmigaOS4 or
MorphOS.


Before you start the installation
---------------------------------
YAM 2.5+ not only uses newer  configuration files, the files  used to store
separate emails are named differently  as well. Therefore, before you start
the  installation  script to  overwrite  your  existing installation,  it's
strongly recommended that you create a backup of your old YAM installation,
including all folders  and configuration files. Afterwards  you can install
the update into your old YAM directory  if you wish. On  start-up, YAM 2.5+
will automatically convert  your old  configuration files  to the  new 2.5+
format,  and after  being  started,  YAM will  rename  your  old emails  as
necessary,  always under  your control.  It  is also  recommended that  you
re-save your  configuration as  soon as  possible in  order to  update your
.config  file to  the new  format, which  will reveal  all the  new options
available.

In addition,  please note  that since  YAM 2.5 no  YAM: assign  is required
anymore. That means, you may even install it in a new location and start it
right  away from  there  without  having to  touch  your old  installation.
Afterwards you  may manually import  the mails from your  old installation.


What's new
----------
Here's a  list (in  alphabetical order)  of the  brave developers  who have
contributed   to    this   release    since   the   last    official   one:

              Jens Langner
              Thore Boeckelmann

And here's a  PARTIAL list of the  changes in this version  with respect to
the previous official 2.8 update:

- updated translations for czech, greek, swedish, french, spanish, italian,
  turkish language.
- fixed an issue related to BetterString.mcc which cause YAM to crash.
- extended the ADDRLOAD command to take a second parameter OPEN/S to
  immediately open then address book window after the address book file
  has been loaded successfully.
- added a new option in the hidden section of the configuration. Setting the
  option "OverrideFromAddress" to "Y" will add a recipient string object
  below the identity chooser in the write window. The contents default to
  the chosen identity's address but can be modified freely. This makes it
  possible to use a different From: address than the one configured in the
  identity while still using all other settings like the SMTP server.
- renamed the 'Bounce' mail functionality for redirecting emails to alternative
  recipients to 'Redirect' as that better reflects the purpose of this
  functionality and should not confuse users anymore. Also adapted the
  functionality to add all well-known Resent-#? headers to redirected emails.
  This should adapt YAM to be somehwat more RFC compliant. Furthermore, a
  Resent-CC and Resent-BCC can now be specified. In addition, YAM will now
  allow to bounce to multiple emails in one operation. That means, a user
  can now select more than one mail in the mail listview and when a redirect
  operation is performed YAM will redirect all of these mails in one run.
- fixed bug where hidden Cc, BCC or Reply-To string gadgets could have ended
  up at wrong positions when hiding/showing them dynamically in the write
  window.
- fixed a bug where 'new' mail was never changed to 'unread' status if it was
  moved to a subfolder. Now the index of all folders carrying 'new' mail will
  be loaded and the status adapted accordingly.
- fixed a problem where under certain setups the automatically chosen full
  qualified domain name (FQDN) was unluckily chosen and thus mail sending being
  rejected when using YAM. Now YAM should use a better mechanism and even let
  you override the FQDN using a new hidden 'MachineFQDN' option.
- fixed a crash where it could have happened that YAM accessed an invalid
  memory location when creating a new mail.
- added a new 'WRITEIDENTITY' ARexx command to let a script choose the user
  identity to be used when composing a new mail via ARexx.
- fixed a bug where the signature settings of a folder got lost when updating
  from YAM versions <= 2.7 to 2.8
- fixed a crash when entering certain text in the CC string gadget of a write
  window.
- fixed some problems with the new Drafts folder managment where emails could
  end up duplicated. In addition, the 'Hold' button has been renamed to 'Save
  to Drafts' to better differentate between the operations.
- fixed a bug where the number of mails in the outgoing folder was not correctly
  set when a mail was moved by mail filter operation.
- fixed a bug where the From: address was not properly restored when the hidden
  "OverrideFromAddress" option had been used.
- fixed a bug where keeping the write window open for a while could suddenly
  crash YAM.
- fixed some crashes related to virtual email display (e.g. opening .eml
  attachments).
- fixed a bug in the mail header parsing routines where a header line starting
  with a newline cause problems.
- fixed a memory trashing problem where toolbar images of different sizes cause
  some memory leaks within TheButton.mcc.
- fixed a bug where resaving a mail in the drafts folder caused the mail
  active/inactive state to get messed up.
- modified remote filters to be applied when getting the single message details.
  This makes it possible to let the filters check all available information but
  it also requires the user to wait until the details of all new mails have been
  received. Otherwise it could have happened that some mails were not received
  although they should be filtered out.
- fixed a crash bug when deleting a folder group.
- fixed some incorrect dimensions of certain theme images.

If  you want  to have  a more  detailed technical  information on  what was
actually  changed, please  have a  look at  the included  'ChangeLog' file.
You can also consult the official YAM homepage for more information on the
changes done with YAM 2.8p1 (e.g. see http://yam.ch/milestone/YAM%202.8p1)

What is still missing?
----------------------
- lots of translators! YAM 2.4 featured lots of different languages, but
  due to the large amount of changed texts these catalogs are completely
  outdated. Especially support for such common languages as Danish,
  Finnish, etc. is currently missing. If you are a native speaker
  of a language that YAM does not offer (anymore), then please contact us.
  See http://yam.ch/wiki/Localization for more information.
- lots of documentation! As with the translation, the documentation largely
  lags behind. Again, if you are a native speaker (even for English) and if
  you are interested in updating/writing YAM's documentation then please
  contact us. Now that with YAM 2.8+ we have switch to a pure online-based
  documentation system people are welcome updating the online documentation
  which can be found at http://docs.yam.ch/ and is based on a public wiki
  engine.
- now that YAM 2.5+ comes with a new themes management, users are free to
  create own themes in a fashion that allow them to exchange them with
  other users. So go and create your own themes and submit them via
  AmiNET&Co! :)

Source code
-----------
Due to lack of time and motivation, Marcel Beck stopped working on YAM back
in 2000, but the sources were released under the GNU General Public License
at SourceForge.net. If you want to  help developing this program further or
perhaps you are considering a port  to a different operating system, please
consider joining the YAM Open Source team  instead of doing it on your own.
Our  home page  is  at http://yam.ch/  from which  you  can obtain  all
necessary  information   to  contact  us.   We  want  to  hear   from  you!

Donations
---------
If you  like the development of  YAM and you  want to give our  open source
developers an additional motivation to continue  to update YAM in future or
if you simply want to say "Thanks", the YAM project accepts money donations
via PayPal.  All the  donations during  a release  cycle are  collected and
divided by considering  the activity of each developer during  the time the
development lasted. This way we hope  to attract more developers in future,
which   in   turn  should   give   you   a   new  version   more   quickly.

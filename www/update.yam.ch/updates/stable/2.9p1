                         YAM - Version 2.9p1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

About YAM
---------
YAM (Yet Another Mailer) lets you send and receive electronic mail (e-mail)
over the Internet and maintain archives  of messages in your computer via a
graphical  user interface.  The idea  came to  the original  author (Marcel
Beck)  back in  1995  when  he first  tried  using  e-mail. The  programmes
available at the time were either powerful but complicated to configure, or
else  used a  too  limiting user  interface. The  goal,  therefore, was  to
program a  cross between AdMail and  AirMail, with a few  ideas coming from
Pegasus Mail.

While  earlier  versions  of  YAM were  developed  closed  source,  today's
versions are developed  by an independent open source  community. Since the
year 2000 a group of mixed developers maintain YAM and release new versions
from time  to time.  While these  versions are all  targeted for  the Amiga
platform,  versions of  different AmigaOS  incarnations are  supplied. This
includes native  PowerPC ports to  modern Amiga platforms like  AmigaOS4 or
MorphOS.


Before you start the installation
---------------------------------
YAM 2.5+ not only uses newer  configuration files, the files  used to store
separate emails are named differently  as well. Therefore, before you start
the  installation  script to  overwrite  your  existing installation,  it's
strongly recommended that you create a backup of your old YAM installation,
including all folders  and configuration files. Afterwards  you can install
the update into your old YAM directory  if you wish. On  start-up, YAM 2.5+
will automatically convert  your old  configuration files  to the  new 2.5+
format,  and after  being  started,  YAM will  rename  your  old emails  as
necessary,  always under  your control.  It  is also  recommended that  you
re-save your  configuration as  soon as  possible in  order to  update your
.config  file to  the new  format, which  will reveal  all the  new options
available.

In addition,  please note  that since  YAM 2.5 no 'YAM:' assign is required
anymore. That means, you may even install it in a new location and start it
right  away from  there  without  having to  touch  your old  installation.
Afterwards you  may manually import  the mails from your  old installation.
Thus, you can in principle now have to independent installation of YAM
using two completly different versions.


What's new
----------
Here's a  list (in  alphabetical order)  of the  brave developers  who have
contributed   to    this   release    since   the   last    official   one:

              Jens Maus
              Thore BÃ¶ckelmann

And here's a  PARTIAL list of the  changes in this version  with respect to
the previous official update:

- fixed a thread safety issue which resulted in GUI operations being executed
  not from the main YAM thread but from a different thread. This caused MUI to
  popup a warning under certain circumstances when downloading mails.
- switched the whole catalog translation mechanism from manually submitting
  translated .ct files to the use of the free services of transifex.com. Now
  translators can freely use the services of transifex.com and submit
  translations online via https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/yam/.
- Slightly changed the logical of the mail reply action in terms of mailing
  lists. YAM will now directly reply to the Mail-Followup-To header entry if a
  matching mailing list is found. In addition, the SHIFT key will now make sure
  that a reply will always end up at the sender of a mail. Contrary to that,
  pressing the ALT key will directly reply to all (e.g. the mailing list).
- fixed the folder conversion routines to not loose connection to the
  destination folder in case of a move-to-folder operation.
- fixed a problem where the installer script failed on AmigaOS3 with "Unmatched
  parenthesis in line 885"
- fixed a minor cosmetic bug where the wrong config page titles were displayed.
- fixed the signature text editor to not parse the signature text via the
  ParseEmailText() function as otherwise the text styles end up in mixing up a
  specified signature.
- fixed the incorrect conversion of filters from older YAM versions when using
  an AND combination of rules.
- fixed a problem with the "Content-Disposition:" MIME header line which was
  set to 'inline' for plain text attachments. This cause problems with some
  mail clients (e.g. Apple Mail) which always displayed these attachments as
  part of the mail text not allowing to save them as separate attachments.
- fixed a bug where quoted real names in an email address string was
  incorrectly added to YAMs emailcache mechanism.
- fixed a bug where upon creating a new addressbook group new entries couldn't
  be inserted into that group until a reload of the addressbook had been
  performed.
- fixed a bug which prevented the user images in the address book and mail
  information part of the read window from working on MorphOS.
- fixed a bug where the display name of standard mail folders (e.g. incoming)
  couldn't be changed.
- fixed a minor bug regarding the transparency settings of the donate image in
  the About window of YAM.
- Mails put on "hold" by older versions of YAM without a dedicated Drafts
  folder will now be moved from the Outgoing folder to the Drafts folder upon
  startup to avoid being sent out by accident.
- fixed a bug where a setting the disabled state of filter rules always cause
  to set complete disabled state of the whole filter.
- fixed a minor bug in the MAILCHECK Arexx command where the STEM variables
  weren't correctly initialized.
- fixed a long standing bug where a Drag&Drop operation from a mail to the
  address book didn't actually add the address to the drop position.
- modified the Cc and BCC text fields to be actually localizable by
  translators.
- Fixed a bug where the small attachment list in the first tab of the write
  window wasn't updated if attachments were added in the 'attachments' tab.
- Downloading an update archive will now always show the transfer window to
  inform the user about the download's progress no matter what if the transfer
  window is configured to be invisible for mail transfers.
- the online ARexx documentation (http://doc.yam.ch/) can now be directly
  accessed via the corresponding main menu item.
- reworked the Installer script to check for a running instance of YAM. If that
  is the case then the user is prompted to terminate that instance to make sure
  that no files which might get overwritten during the installation are locked.
  After the installation a reboot is recommended to ensure that updated
  libraries and classes are really flushed from memory.
- fixed a rare crash bug where YAM crashed in DateStamp2String() due to a
  missing NULL pointer check.
- added the missing folder icons to the supplied AISS theme which was
  complaining about these missing icons.
- For empty IN pattern files the edit button will be disabled now. Only the
  popup button will be enabled to let the user select an existing pattern file.
- fixed a bug in the mail parsing routines where it could have happened that
  YAM was parsing over the boundaries of a readable MIME part if the text
  contained many UTF8 convertable characters.

If  you want  to have  a more  detailed technical  information on  what was
actually  changed, please  have a  look at  the included  'ChangeLog' file.
You can also consult the official YAM homepage for more information on the
changes done with YAM 2.9p1 (http://yam.ch/milestone/YAM%202.9p1)

What is still missing?
----------------------
- lots of translators! YAM 2.4 featured lots of different languages, but
  due to the large amount of changed texts these catalogs are completely
  outdated. Especially support for such common languages as Danish,
  Finnish, etc. is currently missing. If you are a native speaker
  of a language that YAM does not offer (anymore), then please contact us.
  See http://yam.ch/wiki/Localization for more information.
- lots of documentation! As with the translation, the documentation largely
  lags behind. Again, if you are a native speaker (even for English) and if
  you are interested in updating/writing YAM's documentation then please
  contact us. Now that with YAM 2.8+ we have switch to a pure online-based
  documentation system people are welcome updating the online documentation
  which can be found at http://docs.yam.ch/ and is based on a public wiki
  engine.

Source code
-----------
Due to lack of time and motivation, Marcel Beck stopped working on YAM back
in 2000, but the sources were released under the GNU General Public License
at SourceForge.net. If you want to  help developing this program further or
perhaps you are considering a port  to a different operating system, please
consider joining the YAM Open Source team  instead of doing it on your own.
Our  home page  is  at http://yam.ch/  from which  you  can obtain  all
necessary  information   to  contact  us.   We  want  to  hear   from  you!

Donations
---------
If you  like the development of  YAM and you  want to give our  open source
developers an additional motivation to continue  to update YAM in future or
if you simply want to say "Thanks", the YAM project accepts money donations
via PayPal.  All the  donations during  a release  cycle are  collected and
divided by considering  the activity of each developer during  the time the
development lasted. This way we hope  to attract more developers in future,
which   in   turn  should   give   you   a   new  version   more   quickly.

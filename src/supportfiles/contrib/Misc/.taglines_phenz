I was there at the dawn of the third age of mankind. It began in the earth
year 2257 with the founding of the last of the Babylon stations, located
deep in neutral space. It was a port of call for refugess, smugglers,
businessmen, diplomats and travellers from hundred worlds. It could be a
dangerous place, but we accepted the risk because Babylon 5 was our last
best hope for peace. Under the leadership of its final commander, Babylon 5
was a dream given form. A dream of a galaxy without war, when species from
different worlds could live side by side, in mutual respect. A dream that
was endagered as never before by the arrival of one man on a mission of
destruction. Babylon 5 was the last of the Babylon5 stations.
This is it압 story...

work out their differences peacefully. It압 a port of all - home away
from home for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs, and wanderers. Humans
and aliens wrapped in two million, five hundred thousand tons of spinning
metal, all alone in the night. It can be a dangerous place, but it압 our
last best hope for peace, This is the story of the last of the Babylon
stations. The year is 2258. The name of the place is Babylon 5.
-- Commander Jeffrey Sinclar

The Babylon Project was our last, best hope for peace. A self-contained
world five miles long, located in neutral territory. A place of commerce
and diplomacy for a quarter of a million humans and aliens. A shining
beacon in space, all alone in the night. It was the dawn of the Third Age
of Mankind... the year the Great War cam upon as all. This is the story of
the last of the Babylon stations. The year is 2259. The name of the place is
Babylon 5.
-- Captain John Sinclair
%%
The Babylon5 Project was our last, best hope for peace. It failed. But,
in the Year of the Shadow War, it became something greater: our last,
best hope... for victory. The year is 2260. The place: Babylon 5.
-- Commander Susan Ivanova
%%
It was the year of fire. The year of destruction. The year we took back
what was ours. It was the year of rebirth. The year of great sadness.
The year of pain. And the year of joy. It was a new age. It was the end
of history. It was the year everything changed. The year 2261.
The place: Babylon 5.
